We will find out what is the number of cancer patients in the state and in which area which cancer has been found more.
Chicken pox varicella.
Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster VZV.
Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox.
A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops.
It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox.
It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds.
In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby.
Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i.e.till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started.
Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles.
In most of the children 200-300 blisters erupt that later become scabs.
Chicken pox can attack both young and adult , men and women.
Most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence.
But if adults who had never been a victim of chicken pox come into contact with such a case , they are in danger of contraction and they may suffer from chicken pox in adulthood.
Chicken pox is more serious in adolescents and adults in comparison with children.
Fever stays for a longer time.
Keeping infected persons away from school or work helps in decreasing the spread of the virus but vaccination is an effective solution to escape the pain of chicken pox.
Fever is estimated with symptoms like high fever , acute body pain , headache , joint pain , eye pain and finding of papules on body.
Besides the above general symptoms , complaints of bleeding from teeth , mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox.
Tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than 1 lac on blood test.
Dengue fever occurs after a sting of aedes aegypti.
Aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time.
Do not keep water collected at home in coolers , in tanks on root , empty disused tin cans , in tyres , in flower pots , in empty bottles , money plants , bottles and cisterns.
Keep the water in coolers , tubs , pitchers at home changing twice a week.
Do not let water collect near home.
Fill the ditches with soil.
If filling with soil is not possible , spray kerosene oil etc.in the ditch.
Use neem oil or mustard oil over body.
Use full sleeve shirts and socks.
You must get boys wear full sleeve clothes and socks when they are going to school.
Get insecticides sprayed at home.
Keep the environment clean at home and nearby.
Get treatment during the disease outburst , on coming of fever at the government hospital health center.
You must use mosquito nets or anti-mosquito incense sticks while sleeping.
You must install nets on windows , doors and clerestorys.
Non-steroidal drugs should not be taken in dengue fever.
Diabetes is such a kind of disease as a result of which sugar becomes very high in blood.
Diabetes is a serious disease which , if not controlled , can be killing.
On being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar.
Sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin.
If you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes.
Frequent feeling of urination.
Feeling more thirsty and dim vision.
Physical inability in sexual activities.
Numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them.
Problems occurring from diabetes.
The following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes.
Excess of sugar in blood , long term complexities.
Damage to tendons or neuropathy.
Damage to kidney or nephropathy.
Damage to eyes or retinopathy.
Disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels.
Long term complexities of diabetes.
damage to tendons : diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands.
Shivering , numbness , inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards.
If treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs.
Damage to kidney : Delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required.
Diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness.
Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur.
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes.
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this.
Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion.
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle.
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests.
Every disease occurs due to a type of virus.
Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope.
If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person.
After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person.
Usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes -.
High fever.
Acute pain.
Stiffness in neck.
Stiffness in body.
Strokes in body.
Nausea and vomiting.
Fainting or total nervousness.
As soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health center , sub-divisional government hospital or district hospital.
Malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community.
Disease carrying mosquitoes mainly reside outside home in paddy fields , ponds and ditches filled with water.
Pay special attention towards cleanliness at home and outside.
Fill the ditches , cut tall grass and bushes.
Wear pants , pyjama , dhoti , socks , full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening.
Use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible.
Do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house.
Cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging.
Use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties.
Get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time.
Hepatitis-A is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world.
This occurs due to Hepatitis-A virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness.
Virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients.
Hepatitis-A viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage.
The virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious.
Therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops.
Nausea , jaundice , purge , light colored faeces , stomach ache , weakness , tiredness , fever , shivering , not feeling hungry , neck pain etc.
Symptoms are dependent on the frequency of emergence.
Hepatitis-A and V are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses.
Every type of hepatitis is different.
Hepatitis-A can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-B.
Similarly , hepatitis-B can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-A.
The vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitis-A.
Primary vaccination keeps a person safe for a year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about 20 years.
A combined vaccine is available from Glaxosmithkline which provides safety from , both hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B through a single safety order administered at 0 , 1 , 6 months.
The combined vaccine of hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B is available in two forms.
Paediatric dose : One dose is of 0.5 ml for children and adolescents.
Adult dose : The dose is of 1.0 ml for adults of the age of 16 years and above.
Hepatitis-B is a worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitis-B virus HBV.
HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs.
The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted.
The results of infection are different and unexpected.
The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system.
Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV.
In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year.
Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included.
HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person.
The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination.
After vaccination people who have developed protective anti-bacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases.
With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B.
Yellow fever is also called yellow jack , black vomit , Negro 's vomit or American Plague.
The combined vaccine is made for children and adults.
What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again ?.
The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence.
The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952.
On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo Egypt in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare.
All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services.
Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born.
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India.
This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state.
Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh.
Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only.
Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar.
Gross reproduction rate the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3.3.
Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period.
Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas.
It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state.
Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas.
About one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within 24 months.
A little less than half of the mothers 46 percent give birth to more than 3 kids.
About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger.
It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular.
According to the estimates of Sample Registration System S.R.S.the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9.
The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate 68.
Two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself.
Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births.
Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available.
Considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high.
Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization.
The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate.
This program is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme , to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women , to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies.
The goal of health programs is to increase the rate of parent security to 49.0 percent till 2006 , 55.0 percent till 2010 , and 95 percent till 2020.
The rate of childbirth security to 60 percent till 2006 , 80 percent till 2010 and institutional childbirths has increased to the maximum.
Main works under the Reproductive and Child Health Programme.
Main works being run under the program are as follows.
Organisation of R.C.H.camps.
Organisation of R.C.H.Outdoor sessions.
Appointment of women health workers on contract.
Comprehensive construction work and repairing of health units.
Urban Reproductive and Child Health Programme.
Appointment of supplementary A.N.M.on contract.
Appointment of 258 supplementary A.N.M.on contract basis in the unserved and rural areas has been made to increase the immunisation of mothers and children and the acceptability of contraceptives.
On the directions of the Government of India service is being made available at 39 PHCs and 26 CHCs with the goal to provide secure childbirth from 8 o'clock at night to 7 o'clock in the morning at PHCs and CHCs.
900 untrained midwives have been trained in Uttarakhand in the year of 2001-2002 and 2002-03 to provide services of safe labor to pregnant mothers.
560 untrained midwives have been trained in the year of 2004-2005.
5 Safe Maternity Counsellors Women Medical Officer were accepted to be appointed by the Government of India on a contract basis under the E.A.G.scheme.
After the advertisements in newspapers for appointment three women medical officers were selected out of which only 1 women medical officer has reported her contribution at Agastyamuni CHC of district Rudraprayag.
Care of the health of women and children and vaccination is being done on a village council level by organising an Outreach Session on a defined day Saturday by women health workers at the level of each village council in the state.
The said program has been scrapped by the Govt.of India since July , 2004.
But the above mentioned program is being run in the state with the help of women health workers.
Medicines are being bought at the state level under the RCH program.
RCH kits are being provided directly to the districts by the Government of India.
For equipments bought at the level of the state the provision is to purchase after the recommendation of the Executive Committee constituted at the state level by the Purchase Committee constituted at the level of the Head Office.
Special work has been done in districts in the year of 2003-2004 for propagation of NSV without cut , without stitch method to increase the participation men in population stabilisation.
Population stabilisation , installation of stable RN hoarding , wall paintings , orientation of the members of the Panchayati Raj and medical and paramedical staff from the medical department and other media exhibition etc.were done.
Leprosy is a bacteria born contagious disease.
The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae.
Microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin.
Incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly.
Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally.
The M.D.T.medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society.
All the leprosy patients are not contagious.
Most of the patients are non-contagious who can not spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious.
Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles , T.B.etc.
About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them.
The main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows.
A light yellow or discolored reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness , i.e.the spot has no feeling of pain , inflammation , itching or piercing or cold and hot.
Oily shine on the skin.
Thickness of cyst on skin , eyebrows , chin , ears.
Do not do any hard work for three months after the operation of hernia.
Thrilling sensation , numbness or dryness in hands or feet.
Occurrence of deformation in the fingers of hands or feet.
Initiation and spread of leprosy.
Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb.
If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication.
If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing.
Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly.
Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage.
Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients.
Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines.
Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood.
Malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito.
Female anopheles mosquitoes get born in clean water and bites at night.
Fever along with shivering and cold comes often the third day.
You must change water collected in pots at home once a week.
Use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard oil on open parts of the body.
Install fine nets on windows of house.
Do not let water collect near yourself.
If this is not possible then pour some petro-lubricants oil on the collected water.
The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent.
Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible.
Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months.
Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin.
Besides this , loose motion , stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction.
In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10-12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period.
During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well.
After this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease.
The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease.
Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining.
Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth.
Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps.
Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths.
Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while.
The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules.The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children.
About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly.
When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened.
Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR.
MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine.
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective.
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life.
Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy.
However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme.
The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles.
Therefore now it is recommended by both W.H.O.and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles.
Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel.
Such a system of brain is called mental disorder.
It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease.
It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill.
Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality.
Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease.
Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries.
It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up.
Not paying attention to any work.
Being sad without any reason.
Getting angry very soon , very often.
Change in mood very soon , being sorry from happiness and getting happy again.
Getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children.
Thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong.
Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana.
Problem in desire or the process of copulation.
Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen and then his physical and mental test is done.
If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done.
Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods.
Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health.
Encouraging the patient to change emotionally.
Making people aware by propagating for mental health through press , T.V., radio , health fairs , posters , banners etc in every district.
Making social environment better , encouraging participation and social relations among people in the society.
Finding out about the mental , social and personality change since the start.
Running tests in schools , colleges , government and non-government institutes.
Treating emotional and mental disorders , enabling families to undergo difficult situations.
Solving the social and personal problems of the patient.
Treating the mental patient and lessening the difficulty of the family and society.
Saving a mental patient from falling ill again.
The following is be executed in the state under the mental health program.
State Mental Health Authority has been constituted in the state since 4 April , 2002.
A 30 bed State Mental Hospital is being constructed at Dehradun under the Mental Health Authority program.
Two districts of Uttarakhand have been chosen under the District Mental Health Programme.
Dehradun in the Garhwal division and Nainital in the Kumaun division.
For which a proposal of 184.30 lac has been sent to the Government of India.
This program will be implemented in both the districts of Dehradun and Nainital.
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme has been transferred from Social Welfare Department to Health Welfare Department since 14.9.2001 by the Government of India.
The process of transfer is now complete.
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme is being implemented by the Health Department in the state of Uttarakhand.
Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs.500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition.
The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows.
The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services.
A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level.
The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18.
There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas.
More than three fourth of the women 78 percent in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so.
A little more than one third 39 percent of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills.
In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T.T., however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent.
Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service -.
Indicating pregnant women.
Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases.
There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand.
This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives.
Even in urban areas more than half 56 percent of childbirths takes place at home.
In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives.
Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth 14 percent is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months.
Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post-childbirth services.
Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion.
A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table.
The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans.
This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person.
However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth.
Polio disease particularly attacks young children.
80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age.
Polio is an extremely contagious disease.
Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities.
Oral Poliovirus Vaccine OPV was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union.
As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries.
The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world.
The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful.
Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help.
By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis.
Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose.
Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less.
Sex related diseases are contagious diseases.This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse.
This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy.
Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy.
Sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful.
The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia.
Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment.
Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children.
Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen between naval and the reproductive organs.
Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women.
Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting.
Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs.
If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them.
Dead birth due to inborn syphilis.
The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases.
Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction.
Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye.
Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease.
The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease.
Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs.
Keep away from uncommon sexual relations.
Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse.
HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases.
It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities.
Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed.
Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment.
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease.
Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis.
The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex.
A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year.
About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases.
Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes.
This disease is found commonly in the lungs.
In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease.
Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much.
The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much.People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done.
In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis.
According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year.
The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India.
Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac.
In comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in India.
The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined.
This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis.
In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times.
Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy.
Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis of the lungs.
The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm.
The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing.
The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis.
Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary.
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested.
Tuberculosis can be completely cured.
If the patient does the treatment regularly.
There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment.
Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy.
In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers.
Which is called DOTS Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy.
As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker.
There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis.
Intensive phase which goes on for 2-3 months.
Continuation phase is of 4-5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking.
Under this program these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2-3 months intensive phase.
After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti-tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi-blistered combo pack.
Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker.
During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete.
You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase.
The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test.
Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease.

Tetanus is a type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust , dirt and rusted metals.
The bacteria of tetanus enters inside through normal cuts occurring to the body.
Muscles convulse because of the bacteria.
If the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes.
Generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when a person is already infected with a flavivirus.
After the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally , after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries.
The muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus.
This is a kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm a kind of sticky , wet material due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if a dog is barking.
The start of yellow fever starts suddenly 3 to 5 days after the infection.
Because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis infection of the lungs.
Typhoid fever is such a disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of a full-fledged disease.
The cause of typhoid is a type of insect that is called salmonella typhi.
Each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms - periodic fever , headache , tiredness and weakness , change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion.
When any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen.
If these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine.
Vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever.
Typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas.
This vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as a major public health problem in the persons of that age group.
Salmonella typhi with antibiotic resistance is found in typhoid fever.

The death rate goes up to 85 % on the spread of yellow fever as an epidemic.
Yellow fever disease spreads in different ways in the rural and jungle areas and in the urban areas.
The effect is very high in the cities due to more density of population and more carrier mosquito population.
There is no real treatment for yellow fever.
Most of the virus generated diseases do not have a cure , only corollary treatment and treatment on the basis of symptoms are done.
The patient of fever should be given a lot of rest , fresh air and plenty of liquid to drink.
In the hamster model of the yellow fever using ribavirin early is considered to an effective treatment.
Ribavirin is effective in yellow fever in the same as it proves effective in hepatitis-C.
Historical report says that the death rate in this disease has been from 5.8 % to 33 %.
CDC has said that the death rate is considered to be 15.
While the WHO has said in a fact sheet issued in 2001 that 15 % patients enter a toxic stage in which half of them die and half are saved.
Yellow fever has an very important place in the history of Afric , America , Europe and the Caribbean Islands.
Yellow fever spread the worst in 1978 in the United States due which 20 thousand had died in Mississippi valley itself.

In infrared thermography , breast cancer due to ill effects of lethal radiation can be tested as fast as possible.
Greek and Egyptian doctors were aware of the disease of breast cancer and temperature of the body.
Sir William Harchell discovered infrared and thermal radiations in 1800 AD.
But till 1970 it was not certain that infrared could be used in the field of medicine.
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in its very initial days.
Lacs of women can be benefitted from breast thermography.
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of arteries being narrow as well etc.in diabetes.

The word ' arthritis ' means ' the swelling of joints ' and more than even 100 types of joint swellings have been put under the category of arthritis.
At any age arthritis disease can take one in its captivity.
Arthritis disease has been seen in kids as well.
This disease is a common thing in people of 50 years and above.
In people of 50 years and above this disease also happens in serious and more painful condition.
As the age increases , the cases of arthritis also increase.
3 persons out of every 5 below 65 years of age have been seen to be patients of arthritis.
If the cure and treatment of arthritis is not done on time then it causes great damage to the joints and bones of the body.
Although arthritis is a disease affecting women world wide.
In our country this disease affects women even more because of special actions like sitting down for toilet or sitting down on floor for domestic work.
The knee joint is actually the joint between the thigh bone femur and the bone of foot tibia.
The cartilage once destroyed may not be corrected again by any medicine.

If the correct cure of arthritis is done in time then relief to a great extent from this disease is possible.
Fast treatment means less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain.
Generally the advice of surgery is also given on arthritis becoming serious.
In patients where arthritis has reached the preliminary stage , for patients in whom alternatives like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial.
Total hip  knee replacement TKR is useful in case of arthritis affecting the entire joint.
TKR does not mean that the knee of patient is removed and metal implant is fixed.
In TKR new surface is put at the end of the bones.
The newest alternative in knee implant is rotating platform high flexion knee , due to which in all activities like walking , bending during gardening , sitting for driving or exercising , climbing down the stairs the patient gets comfort.
With high flexion knee bending up to 155º is possible.
Much more satisfaction is felt by patients who have already got rotating platform high flexion knee implant and they are able to fulfil the activities of daily life in a better way.

If there is any wart , knot or wound on any part of the body and still does not dry up quickly then be cautious , this can be skin cancer.
Cancer of the skin generally appears in the form of a small knot.
This knot can appear at any place like hand , leg , face etc.
The knot can be of normal color or else of black color.
In preliminary stage the knot is painless and because of this reason we commit grave mistake.
Because of no pain in the knot the patient does not give attention to the treatment of the knot.
With the increase of knot it starts paining.
Many times cancer appears in the form of a small wound.
The wound does not pain if there is cancer.
The cancer of the wound goes on increasing and at one stage pain occurs in that.
Many times cancer appears in non dangerous knots.
Therefore , do not forget any knot.
If there is non dangerous knot in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms.
Wound forming in the knot.
Knot increasing rapidly.
Pain in the knot.
Colour change in the knot.
Cancer of any part of the body spreads through blood and lymph vessels.
That cancer which spreads through blood is more dangerous.
Cancer of skin generally spreads through lymph vessels.
Therefore cancer of skin spreads slowly.
Treatment of skin cancer is done by cutting the cancer infested skin.
With cancer infested skin healthy skin is also removed by cutting because of which chance of cancer being left back ends.
At times lymph glands are also cut and removed with cancerous skin.
It depends on the rapidity of cancer whether the cancerous glands should be cut and removed or not.
The cancer of the skin of the reproductive organs is different from the cancer of skin of other organs.
Other diseases of reproductive organs increase due to hesitation and their proper treatment does not take place.
In situation of cancer of female reproductive organs , the skin of the reproductive organ is cut and removed.
If the cancer has spread up to lymph glands then the lymph gland is also cut and taken out.
Definitely get every knot occurring on the skin checked up.
If there is any knot from several years then in the situation of increase in the knot getting checked up is must.
If pain occurs in the knot of skin then be attentive and definitely get the cancer test done.
If wound occurs in the knot then also being cautious is important.
Every such wound occurring on skin which does not heal in 2 weeks points towards cancer.

The diseases which occur mainly in women , they are - asthma , swelling in uterus or excessive blood flow , infection of reproductive organs or breast cancer.
At present breast cancer is a major disease.
The rapidly increasing number of the disease of breast cancer is a subject of concern for the entire country.
According to a publication by Indian Breast Cancer Association the proportion of women with cancer is more in western countries.
There are also measures to stop and reduce breast cancer.
Breast cancer can not be stopped but a yoke can be put on its growth.
Together with the Indian Government , the WHO is also very effortful in this direction.
According to WHO of all the patients of breast cancer 80 % are those who did not feed their child from their breast after child birth.
When a newborn baby has milk from the breast of his mother then for the baby it is having elixir.
Together with this he also saves his mother from many diseases.
Breast feeding is not just a life saving elixir but it is also a life savior for the mother.
The number of diseases occurring in women is not less but one can be saved from them.
For all this what is most important is awareness in women , being attentive towards own health.
The efforts of WHO is working at a large scale in the world and it affirms that in coming years by making women aware they can be saved from several main diseases.

Days back a surprising report taking up mental problems was published in a national level newspaper.
According to the report , approximately one fourth of the population of the country suffers from some or the other type of mental problems in their lifetime.
This matter can not be completely true but to consider it a guess will also not be correct.
In order to search luxury and comfort man may be making progress by leaps and bounds but his brain has to bear a lot of harms for this.
Old and aged , children , everyone is suffering from various types of mental tension and are coming in the captivities of psychological disorders.
Even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists.
But the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier.
The advice of the psychologists is proving ineffective and modern medicines which suppress the symptoms of the problem are delivering more harm.
In the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient Indian medical science , that is , Ayurveda.
The cure , analysis and treatment of psychological disorders are discussed in detail in Ayurvedic texts.
Maharishi Charak tells about three types of diseases in sutrasthan of ' Charak Samhita ' - 1.nij 2.aagantu 3.maanas.
The Nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders gas , bile , cough.
Aagantu diseases are those which occur due to ghosts microbes , polluted air and maanas diseases are those psychological disorders which occur due to desires and jealousy.
As all of you know , Ayurveda is not just the method of treatment , it is also a science of life.
In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy.
The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body.
If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected.
Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body.
There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it.
The nature of man , his judgement and decisive ability , the multiplicity of his character till the extent of the entire personality depends on these three properties of saatvik , rajsik and tamsik properties.
If there is increase in the rajsik and tamsik properties in man due to his food and life style then he can be surrounded with psychological disorders.
According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence.
Desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride.
Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all.
With the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence , the mental balance disrupts , mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as a result psychological disorders occur.
According to ` Charak samhita ' , in the case of mental disorders , negative effects affect the eight basic psychological causes of will - will , intelligence , memory , feeling , devotion , morality , efforts and behavior.
Due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life.
With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders.
This is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food , excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in Ayurveda.
Renowned Yoga and spiritual Deepak Chopra considers ' radiation and life ' also important together with brilliance for mental health.
According to Dr.Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body.
Radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision.
Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders.
One main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike a proper balance with his surroundings.
In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc.
If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc.
The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now.
Dr.Deepak Chopra says , ' the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body '.
In the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain.
In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain.
Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice.
After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery.
He had also heard something about hernia.
According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc.
Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur.
The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct.
Surgery is its only cure and the more the delay the more increased would be the discomfort.
After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away.
He got the surgery done afterwards according to his physician ' s consultation or stayed in the maze of third or fourth opinion , I do not have any information of this.
It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan.
Like the disease hernia construction of a saclike creation takes place from the swelling of tissues in any particular organ of the patient due to genetic or any other reason.
Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach.
That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach.
But in the essay we will discuss in the context of hernia of stomach.
There are three main kinds of this type of hernia too - inguinal hernia affecting the groin region , umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach.
Inguinal Hernia : This is a swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia.
The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia.
It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction.
The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common.
Umbilical hernia is related to stomach.
Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders.
In fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth.
In some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center.
If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years.
Large sized hernia which does not stop on their own , surgery is important for their treatment.
This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child.
In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth.
But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak.
Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high.
Incisional hernia : A large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach.
Due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common.
Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high.
2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type.
Due to the reason of the permanent weakening of walls of stomach there is a chance for hernia to occur once more for second time through surgery.
One of the main causes of hernia to occur is the weakening of walls of stomach.
This problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons , due to increasing age , as a result of surgery , strain in muscles during pregnancy , reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity , diseases like marfan syndrome etc.
Excessive pressure inside the stomach is also built due to growth of hydrosil , growth of tumor in uterus , due to pregnancy , etc.because of which the walls of stomach become weak and the danger of hernia increases.
It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia.
During the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise.
In affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur.
Swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight , micturition or defecation.
Swelling becomes clearly visible in some cases by staying standing for long or coughing as well.
The pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense.
The intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends.
It is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia.
Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc.
Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor.
Where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or CAT scan done.
The aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil.
The only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself.
Riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery.
Famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy , endoscopy etc.
In some cases open surgery is also done.
For the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days , that surgery is laparoscopy.
Due to being minimal invasive surgery , the surgery is done by putting an incision of only 2 - 3 mm to the patient.
As a result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery.
He gets working in normal way after just two - three days of surgery and within 5 to 7 days he gets to his daily works.
Under this technique of surgery , a laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through a small tube.
Surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen.
By means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia.
The rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach.
A netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem.
With the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost a completely safe process.
Yes , in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen.
Generally during hernioplasty there is a danger of infection in the region of surgery , destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs , etc.
Where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there a well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in a better way in case of complication.
As I told you earlier , the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe.
But from fear of surgery or considering hernia as a less serious disease can put the patient ' s life at risk.
It is worth mentioning that hernia is such a problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time.
If it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult.
In the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene.
Because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops.
Consequently tightness , vomiting , release of gas , actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential.
In some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing.
With no treatment the danger of hydrosil to happen from hernia can also be there.
Therefore do not delay in hernia.
With delay not just the danger of life risk would increase but comparatively there would also be problems in surgery.

Diabetes is not a disease which happens only to aged and obese people.
The treatment of diabetes mellitus sugar found in urine occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition.
In diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas.
Diabetes is of two types.
At some point of time type 1 diabetes was called ' juvenile onset diabetes '.
This is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all.because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas.
This disease may occur with great speed in the age of 6 to 13 years.
In type 2 diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it.
This disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family.
Type 2 diabetes grows gradually.
The symptoms of Type 2 diabetes are frequent micturition , drinking lots of water , dryness of throat , laziness , high pulse rate and blurred vision.
The cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar more than 126 mg.
For the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in a day.
In such situation they can get great relief from counselling.
You should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not a disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other.
In order to keep the balance of blood sugar level OK the insulin has to be balanced and for this make the children exercise daily.
Together with this give him food of this type which has little carbohydrate , balanced quantity of fat , more fiber and less sodium 6 times a day little by little.
The teachers , family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease.
The young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle.
For this they should reform the eating pattern , reduce weight and do exercise.
Keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self - dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth.
He can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of 10 years of age.
When does eye problem occur ?.
If your child has a problem in doing school work.
If he feels pain in eyes , throbbing pain or tiredness.

Then take him to an eye specialist immediately.
Often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious.
Important information connected to antibiotic.
If your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for 48 hours then follow his advice.
If you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for 5 days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of 5 days.
This way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases , consequently that problem can again start to grow.

Our brain of around 1.2 to 1.5 kilogram weight seems to be made of soft matter of brown color.
Our brain is in fact a complex mass of thousand crore of nerve cells only.
The brain of small honeybee is also made up of these cells only.
One unit of brain , neuron or nerve cell is complete and independent in itself.
Every nerve cell has a long tail.
This tail is as small as 1 mm in some , then in others it is as long as thousand mm or one metre.
The brain is an infinite maze of several thousand crores of cells and the mutual network between them.
On the whole either the pregnancy does not stay in women suffering from tumor or even if it stays then many more complications occur during pregnancy.
Like abortion , premature delivery , premature rupture of the amniotic fluid sac , dislocation of placenta premature , weakening of the foetus in the womb , the foetus getting crossed , inverted or skewed.
The child getting stuck at the time of delivery.
The need of caesarean operation for the delivery.
Complications while the operation , need to remove the uterus.
Excessive bleeding post delivery.
Getting anaemic owing to excessive bleeding.
Increase in the size of fibroid.
Many times the cure of uterine glandular swelling is problematic.
The size of uterus also increases in ovarine knot-endometriosis , pregnancy edinomyosis etc.but a skilful gynaecologist can easily find out the disease after a careful examination.
The following tests are important for fibroid.
Sonography through abdomen or vagina transabdominal and transvaginal.
Laparoscopy , hysteroscopy , M.R.I.if needed.
H.S.G.if the doctor thinks essential.
After finding out the condition of fibroid in the uterus with these tests , it can be ascertained by which method it can be removed.
Mere presence of the glandular swelling is not a prerequisite for its removal.
If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory.
There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary.
If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed.
If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy.
The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers.
There are two types of operations for fibroid.
Myomactomy removal of knot only , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy opening stomach.
Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children.
Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor.
Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia.
Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid.
GnRH analog decapeptyl or lupride , mifepristone , danazol are the main medicines.
But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced.
The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine.
The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis through laser Nd-YYAG.
The blocking of uterine artery ambolization.

Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria bacilli.
Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it.
Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein , C.V.Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas.
By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity.
On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell.
In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm.
Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment.
The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India.
In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell.
In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner.
By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them.
The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells.
In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell.
The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two.
Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington.
How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell ?.
There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse.Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine.
Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded.
After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system ?.
What is the benefit of this : The question is in fact very interesting and important.
If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard.
Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only.
In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire.
But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell.
Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction.
Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos.
The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1.0 milli second.
This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time.
The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them.
Synapse has one more use as well.
Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain.
These chemical substances are called medicines.
Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only.
Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult.
Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses.
The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery.
Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually.
Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory.
From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts.
Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body.
Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important.
Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones.
At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body.
Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles.
The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything.
For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect.
We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger.
This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord.
The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only.
Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone.
The entire caravan of all the signals between brain and different parts of the body crosses through this spinal cord alone.
Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious.
But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord.
The brain starts just as we enter the head.
Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain.
On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch.
Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts.
One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it.
In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively.
The lowest most part is medulla oblongata , very small and common in appearance but very special in importance.
The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone.
Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc..
A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment.
But there is nothing to get scared in this.
Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head.
At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged.
The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death.
The same happens when the criminals are hanged.
Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well.
The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc., bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs.
If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come.
Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction.
In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway.
Similarly 3 branches go to the cerebellum mini brain located at the back of brain-stem.
Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs.
First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags.
We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward.
Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely.
Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions.
Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla.
Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain.
Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face.
Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain.
On crossing this line one gets to feel a very important difference.
From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state.
From darkness to light.
We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum.
As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep.
But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake.
We start feeling comfort , sadness.
We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine.
We start saying I am there , I am doing , I am liking it.
Does any machine feel like this ?.
None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours.
Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see.
The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both.
And why should not it be  After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc..
While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body.
But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man.
Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain.
Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body.
Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours.
The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram.
The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body.
If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale.
There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now.
This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres.
Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body.
All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side.
This very system is found in all the organisms.
The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body.
Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere.
Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner.
The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only.
In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread.
The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle.
The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing.
The system of olfaction is at the lower surface.
Though this part in man has become very unimportant in comparison to animals like dogs.
But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain.
Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves.
So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum ?.
Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain ?.
This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed.
Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone.
The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up.
What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely.
It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery.
A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come.
Touch , heat , pressure , pricking everything is felt here only.
But how this : We feel pain in finger when thorn pricks , but not in head.
But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed.
Then only we realize pain.
The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger.
Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system.
If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted.
Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment.
We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like.
This is called paralysis.
Nothing has happened to the muscles , not even to the motor cortex.
Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut.
Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain.
Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs.
In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life.
We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires.and brain ?.
Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer.
Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations.
We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers.
Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction.
But are the methods of both same ?.
In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us ?.
Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate ?.
Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance.
In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well.
Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way.
Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model.
In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc.so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these.
Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain ?.
We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again.
The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off.
But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work.
What does this mean : I am tired , leave , I will not do anymore.
If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer.
The child soon gets bored with useless work.
There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer.
He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before.
Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it ?.
Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin ?.
One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer.
Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking.
The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this.
Thus it is also called spoonerism.
At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain.
If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions.
It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach.
In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it.
But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness.
The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil.
The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second.
Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five.
That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer.
Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them.
Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects.
In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only.
The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette.
But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken ?.
Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges ?.
No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn.
Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them.
Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain ?.
Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum.
Therefore these have the maximum importance in man.
By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other.
Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education.
Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language.
First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant.
Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it.
Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain.
Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks.
It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain.
Can the present human society be imagined without language ?.
Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing ?.
Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them.
In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain.
While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them.
When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side.
The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results.
Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually.
In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him.
Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body.
But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres.
Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal.
In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous.
The same thing has also been seen in all the animals.
It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere.
But when Roger Sperry severed the contact between the two hemispheres then how special is the place of each in our mental activities was estimated for the first time.
If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this -.
Left hemisphere - language speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time.
Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space.
Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division.
But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed.
On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite.
Whatever one cerebral hemisphere learns the other does not get to know anything about that.
As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded.
The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin.
With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments !.
One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth.
In any huge class some students would be uncommon.
That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand.
These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket.
What is their ratio in your school or classroom ?.
In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability.
If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect.
But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale.
To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this.
Breast cancer is a scary name for women.
Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days.
Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer.
The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery.
If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent.
This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture.
In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits.
Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible.
In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography.
In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays.
Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body.
Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800.
But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine.
On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light.
In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately.
This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ.
Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments.
Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed.
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment.
Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important.
Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography.
Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography.
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc..
Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases.
Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease.
Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD.
Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS.
There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections.
STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus.
Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following.
HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease.
HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations.
The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex.
HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women.
On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck.
For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible.
Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms.
Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained.
But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief.
Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners.
Genital herpes is of two types.
After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain.
Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching.
Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge.
In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners.
Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection.
If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby.
Syphilis is a bacterial infection.
Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals.
Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child.
In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain.
At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all.
Many times people ignore it.
These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going.
Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years.
Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack.
Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection.
If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child.
For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also.
Get the infection checked at regular intervals.
If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done.
With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours.
Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite.
The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women.
Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom.
There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men.
But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis.
Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly.
According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial.
For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased.
Health and regular check up -.
Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards.
Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years.
The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap.
It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years.
The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years.
But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years.
Pap test is of two types.
Leukoria test is done to find about common infections.
Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations.
Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal.
Pap infection test is also of two types.
One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled.
Second , ` hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection.
With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not.
The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years.
The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years.
Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer.
Liquid pap test is done for this.
Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast.
According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it.
According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up.
Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year.
Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam.
Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years.
Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion.
The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it.
Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important.
The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time.
After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done.
With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test.
After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not.
Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done.
Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health.
They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper.
There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution.
The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started.
In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause.
Pelvic exam test must be done annually.
With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known.
If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test.
One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years.
If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done.
Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40.
Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years.
After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity.
Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs.
Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery.
Bone densitometry is also done for calcium.
By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out.
After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women.
Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important.
Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer.
Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test.
After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc.is coming in your stomach or not.
Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years.
By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs.
Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years.
That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age.
There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval.
These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity fatness.
Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes.
If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times.
Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled.
If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast.
It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need.
If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken ?.
Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting.
This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today.
Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure.
If the pressure on them is constantly very high then it would have a bad effect on their walls.
As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys.
But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high.
Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure.
If you take two simple roller pumps in place of the two halves of the heart auricle and ventricle then you can do the entire task of the heart.
Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body.
Both the main arteries open in the right auricle.
If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing.
One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries.
In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty.
Medical surgery does this only.
If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead.
Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification.
Artificial lungs are also a very simple apparatus.
A glass vessel full of blood in which oxygen is released in the form of bubbles.
There is a special arrangement so that lather do not form by the bubbles of oxygen.
Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going.
Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible.
The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body.
The heart too needs fuel for its work.
The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers.
Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches.
Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart.
The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart.
The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown.
On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack.
The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography.
These days there is discussion about ultrasonography.
But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century.
It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released.
Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG.
In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back.
Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate.
With its help proper treatment is done by doing medical cure.
The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother.
But it is not like that.
Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated.
Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated.
For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important.
Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery.
Liver is a very important organ of the body.
The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them.
The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound.
Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound.
The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart.
Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive.
Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test.
Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful.
The problem of thyroid gland is also very common.
For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity.
The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG.
One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer.
It is believed that U.S.G.mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography.
It gives cure in 75-90 % cases.
USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity.
The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere.
Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus.
Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it hydrocephalous etc..
Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems.
Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta.
The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta.
By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc..
By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus.
By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine.
Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs.
So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work.
Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus.
In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons.
Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight.
Cataract disease is connected to age and often this makes the people who are more than 50 years of age as its victims.
On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth.
The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries.
According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract.
Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery.
The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases.
This is called white cataract.
In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles.
After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles.
At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery.
To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique.
To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made.
Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye.
Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye.
Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this.
Thus , it is called the suture less surgery.
The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day.
He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months.
The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care.
To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs.
One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes.
One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument.
Expensive machines are used in the technique of phaco emulsification.
Therefore , ` phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries.
Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract.
The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time.
You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part.
Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus.
More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number.
Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that.
But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery.
The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well.
In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves.
The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine.
Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure.
If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray.
Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process.
The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection.
The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number.
Generally this is done in one episode.
One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body.
When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced.
Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain.
Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment.
As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours.
Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months.
Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not.
Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered.
Of course , in complications immediately after treatment bleeding in urine and feeling of intense pain in 1-2 micturition are included.
Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis.
In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more.
The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor.
Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country.
In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision.
You can start the normal daily life in a week.
The action can be repeated if the stone forms again.
The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease.
The problem of uncontrolled micturition -.
in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening.
The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small.
Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine.
Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only.
They stop wetting clothes and bed.
Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women.
It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years , 8 to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more.
The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women.
Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment.
The complication of not having control on urination , the problem of leaking on its own may occur due to the reason of diseases of urinary system or the various diseases of organs situated close to it.
Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes.
The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage.
If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled.
This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder.
But in several women its cause is not diagnosed.
This problem may occur in some due to mental tension.
Women often try to control urine for long time.
The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less.
Clothes may also be spoiled by not having control due to some structural defects in urinary bladder  urinary tract.
If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum fistula or genitals then also the problem may arise.
There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery.
Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible.
The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests.
To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken.
The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause.
If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast.
If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery.
If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it.
If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved.
If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery.
If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity.
Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it.
Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive.
If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done.
Do exercise of pelvis and stomach.
Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination.
Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health.
Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry.
In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing.
If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis.
Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients.
If these increases the will power in patients then also relief may be got from the problems.
These patients get relief in 80 % by using the instrument placed close to the genitals by which the lower part of the urinary bladder gets support.
Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube.
If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery.
Because of not having control over urination in the state of hyperactivity of urinary bladder , women stay in haste , their urine can leak.
This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination.
If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential.
If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination.
Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it.
Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves.
If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained.
Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves.
Many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems.
They are advised to take anti-cholinergic or anti-depressant medicines.
Problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder , obstruction in passage , damage of the nervous system , consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension , may be the reasons of habit.
By finding the root cause treatment should be done.
If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery.
Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this.
The complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in 20 to 40 % adult females.
But the problem is not untreatable , women can become problem free by changing the life style , habits , doing exercise of hips and pelvis , medicine , treatment by surgery and other techniques.
Therefore these should not hesitate , should not feel embarrassed , should lead a healthy , normal life after getting treated by taking advice from a skilled doctor.
This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly.
The complaint of urine infection can occur both in men and women but this complaint is found more in women because the inner part of their genitals stays open.
Slight dirt , showing carelessness in hygiene , wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person.
Therefore , every person should stay beware of it.

Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once.
When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52.
After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much.
The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort.
In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation.
The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever.
In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube.
The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E.Coli bacteria.
The occurrence of urinary infection in females may be a common thing but it is quite shameful and uncomfortable.
Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible.
After intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained.
Light , easily digestible food , carrot , papaya , cucumber , gourd , guava etc should be eaten a lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation.
Lots of water should be consumed.
The cancer of skin is generally of three types.
Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer.
The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above.
While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous.
The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor.
This tumor can appear on any part of the body.
Like hand , leg , face etc..
The tumor can be of normal color or of black color.
In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor.
Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor.
When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer.
Which has spread in other parts of the body as well.
At times cancer appears in the form of a small wound.
The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain.
The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain.
The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that.
But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body.
At times cancer appears in hairless tumors.
Therefore , do not forget any tumor.
No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known.
Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms.
Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor.
If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor.
Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful.
Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body.
Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin.
If a tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor , getting tested is a must.
If pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done.
If wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important.
Each such wound appearing on the skin , which does not get healed in 2 weeks , signals towards cancer.
Generally , the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone.
Therefore , generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed.
The skin of the place which has cancer , from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands.
Treatment of the cancer of the skin : along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed.
By which the danger of cancer being left back is removed.
At times , along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed.
It depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not.
Carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound , towards warts and painless tumor , towards genitals.
The cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs.
Although the beginning of cancer starts just with a tiny tumor or wound , but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late.
At times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals.
Not only cancer but other diseases of genitals also continues to grow due to hesitation and its proper treatment does not take place.
In the condition of cancer of female genitals : the skin of the genitals are cut and removed.
If the cancer has spread up to the lymph glands then the lymph glands also have to be cut and removed.
The meaning of arthritis is ` swelling of the joints ' and more than 100 different types of swelling of joints have been put under the category of arthritis.
Arthritis disease can take in its captive at any age.
Arthritis disease is seen in children as well.
The arthritis disease is a common thing in people of 50 years and more.
The arthritis disease in them occurs in grim condition and is more painful.
As the age increases , the cases of arthritis also increase and 3 out of every 5 people have been seen as the patients of arthritis in the age group of less than 65.
If the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis is not done in time then by this a lot of harm occurs to the joints and bones of the body.
In fact arthritis is a disease affecting the women world over.
repeated.

repeated.
Which along with being a shock absorber also reduces the friction of the bones.
But in the patients of arthritis , this cartilage weakens due to abrasion or else gets fully damaged because of which intense pain in the joints , weakness is felt and swelling also occurs.
repeated.
Because of the damage to this cartilage the arthritis infested patient faces difficulties in activities like walking , climbing up the stairs and sitting down or taking bath by sitting on the ground.
Generally if there is persisting pain in joints of knees , elbows , ankles , shoulders , neck , hands etc.and if there is intense pain in normal activities like walking , getting up from the chair , bending while working or bending to pick something from down then the signal of this matter should be understood that the time to consult the doctor has come.
Because of arthritis not just there is swelling and stiffness in the joints but several times redness is also seen in the joints.
If the correct diagnosis of arthritis is done in time then relief from the disease is possible to a very great extent.
The meaning of quick treatment is less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain.
Generally the advice of surgery is also given when the arthritis becomes serious.
Similarly the patients in whom arthritis has reached the initial stage.
For them the options like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial.
In condition of arthritis affecting the entire joint the total hip replacement TKR is useful.
The meaning of TKR is not this that a metal implant is fixed by removing the knee of the patient.
In fact in the TKR procedure a new layer is put at the end of the bones.
In this way the knee becomes totally safe and complete bending and bowing becomes possible.
Knee transplant is the latest technique in which the patient gets relief in various activities like walking , bending while gardening , sitting while driving or exercising , climbing up and down the stairs.
In the context of our country it takes new meanings as well because the joints have important role in several types of daily activities like bending or sitting on the floor.
Bending up to 155 degree is possible by high flexion knees and the patient can again come back to his daily routine.
The patients who have already got the rotating platform high flexion knee transplant today experience much more satisfaction and they can finish their daily activity in a much better way.
The riddance from an epidemic like arthritis can be obtained by proper medical care , options of surgery and by adopting balanced life style and proper habits.
And the patient does not have to undergo the suffering condition of pain and decrease in the physical activities.
Apart from medicine and surgery balanced diet also plays an important role in combating with this disease in a better way.
The important things which should be kept in mind in matters of food are as follows :.
Increase the quantities of vitamins , minerals , antioxidants and nutritive substances and by doing this you can keep your weight under control.
The state of arthritis becomes severe by the increase of obesity.
Consume more and more of fresh fruits and vegetables and especially eat more Vitamin C rich fruits like apples , oranges , cherry , peppers , tomatoes , beet root , sweet potato etc so that the joints stay protected.
With fibrous food like whole grain , barley and brown rice also one gets help in maintaining health and especially joints.
Refrain from taking fried food.
Consume more and more of calcium rich food like diary products , dry fruits , soya milk , fish etc..
Calcium rich food keep the bones safe.
Eat such food by which Vitamin D stays in the body.
Our body does not produce calcium , that is obtained from food.
By doing regular exercise also the muscles around the joints become strong.
The density of bones increase by this and the abrasion of joints also decrease.
The habit of alcohol spoils the life of the best of men.
Being irritated of their habit the family members constantly keep trying that from anywhere they should get such a treatment by which the addiction of the drunkard turned member can be removed.
At times this situation is such that the drunkard on getting fed up of his own bad habit thinks of quitting alcohol.
In such situations they start seeking support of such solutions by which they get harmed in place of being profited.
Even after having different types of treatment they get sadness alone.
Help is also taken from the rehabilitation centres but there is limit also for those who help in coming out of the cyclone of intoxication.
In getting rid of the intoxication of alcohol will power of the drunkard works more than treatment.
Even if the family members of the drunkard take him forcibly to the alcohol rehabilitation center and there his treatment is started , his treatment would not be successful till the time he himself develops the desire within himself that he has to quit alcohol.
Naltrekson is such chemical which block the opioid receptors situated in the brain responsible for the feeling of happiness received from intoxication after drinking alcohol.
Apart from taking naltrekson in the form of oral tablets it can also be taken in the form of injection.
But it has been proved by the experiments that taking injection is more effective.
Since naltrekson is intoxication preventive in the purest form therefore till the time it is there in the body no type of excitement would be felt by him on doing any type of intoxication.
The special mixture of naltrekson is made to reach 3-4 metres beneath the skin by making an incision of 1 cm in the lower part of the stomach or behind the arm.
The benefit in this condition is this that on not taking the medicine by the patient or on forgetting to eat medicine the medicine continues to show its effect.
In naltrekson implant also it is important that the patient is kept under the naltrekson treatment for at least 12 months.
Often it happens that those who get oral treatment done they stop the treatment in middle.
While the treatment should last for at least 1 year , along with it the quantity of alcohol is also reduced.
One can get harmed by the consumption of any intoxicating item be it alcohol or smack or any other intoxicating item with naltrekson implant.
In bacterial dysentery the body becomes weak after becoming skinny and fever starts developing.
In the extreme case of bacterial dysentery there is repeated tendency of releasing fecus in the patient but each time very less fecus is discharged.
In bacterial dysentery together with discharge of fecus , vomiting also takes place and the patient feels extremely thirsty.
In bacterial dysentery the tongue gets dried , extreme deficiency of water molecules and the symptoms of food poisoning becomes visible.
In the fecus of the patient of amoebic dysentery entamoeba hystolytica are found and in the stool test of bacterial dysentery bacteria are found.
In the preventive treatment of bacterial dysentery also it is very important to protect edible and drinking items from the flies.
In order to be safe from the bacterial dysentery the fecal release should be done at a definite place and phenyl should be used regularly at such a place.
The patient suffering from bacterial dysentery should be kept warm in bed.
The fomentation of turpentine on stomach is beneficial in bacterial dysentery.
If contracted bacterial dysentery only boiled water should be used for the first 24 hours.
The other treatments of bacterial dysentery are similar to amoebic dysentery.
Rabies is a viral disease which happens in mammals generally by the biting of dog or other animals.
The central nervous system gets affected by rabies and if not treated immediately the death of the patient is inevitable.
The virus of rabies gradually reaches to the central nervous system through the medium of peripheral nervous system.
The effect of rabies takes up to several months to appear.
On the basis of its location in the uterus it is of three types.
Sub mucous , intramural , sub serous.
This can be one or more than one in number.
remove.
Night blindness is a disease of eyes.
When sonography is done because of some other reason then it is found out that there is a tumor in the uterus.
Major among other symptoms of fibroid are.
In day time everything is clearly visible to the patient of night blindness , but at the night time he is not able to see even the nearby things clearly.
In night blindness there is discharge of white color.
In night blindness the eye lens appears to be consisting of minute hole and triangular shape becomes visible behind the cornea.
The care of new born infant.
The infant must be well taken care of at the time of birth.
The nose , throat , mouth , anus etc of the new born baby must be cleaned before it takes the first breath.
Tie the umbilical cord.
The physical investigation of the infant must be done.
For all types of tests for normal conditions post birth like nose , ears , throat , neck , breast , arms , genitals and anus etc should be done.
The new born should be wiped with soft cloth after birth and it must be given bath only after one week.
The infant must be weighed immediately after birth and thereafter it should be given to the mother for breast feeding after wiping it.
The newly born baby must be kept close to the body of the mother.
The child can be saved from hypothermia this way.
The chances of infection in a newly born infant is the maximum , therefore the baby must be saved from infection.
The best way to protect a newly born infant from infection is to lift it after cleaning ones hand with soap beforehand.
Do not take the child to a place where other children are sick.
The role of mother is main in the care of the infant.
The mother should be given the correct information about keeping gap in the birth of next child and the time-table for the inoculations.
Each mother should be educated to identify the symptoms of danger in her child so that she can immediately take her child to the doctor if needed.
If the new born baby is of less weight , is in sick state then it should not be distanced from his mother.
His entire care should be done in front of his parents only.
By parental touch or by taking it in the lap the tension of child decreases.
National Family Planning program was started in the form of sponsored program by the government.
The aim of national family planning program was to keep the population steady in the face of the needs of the national development.
The main aim of the family planning program was to reduce birth rate right from the beginning in order to achieve this aim , for which the various techniques of family planning was to be encouraged in the masses.
The meaning of birth and child health point of view is to accept unanimous and composite view towards the issues of contraception and mother-child health.
Solid methods to control population growth -.
Population growth has been the chief problem of the developing countries.
In order to stop population growth immediately very solid steps have to be take.
Firstly , it is needed to attack poverty.
Appropriate success can not be achieved in this direction without removing this factor mainly responsible for population increase in countries like India.
The nation looks infested with scarcity from all the four sides.
Baldness is not a disease.
At present there has been a flood of the centres for treating baldness in big cities.
Generally , hair starts falling due to high fever , typhoid , syphilis , influenza and lack of blood etc..
Generally baldness is a genetic condition but it begins mostly in the head with the start of itching and irritation.
It has often been seen that the hair of 20-30 year old men falls gradually and after some time they become bald to a great extent.
Therefore it can be prevented in the beginning with safety measures.
It happens very fast in women of less age but the situation of complete baldness arises very less in them.
This is a scientific fact that the hair of healthy people grow everyday and in the place of hair that fall during combing new hair grow on their own from time to time.
Various skin diseases like herpes , ringworm make such a layer on the scalp that the hair starts falling and baldness comes.
The use of cosmetics like oils to prevent hair fall and baldness , the soaps to wash head make such cases even more serious.
Staying in intense light or staying in sunlight for long , special types of beautifying cosmetics and techniques like bleaching and curling of the hair etc.encourage baldness.
Special hair designs in which the hair is twisted and broken and making pony tail especially while sleeping at night and by putting needles and rings in the hair etc may also become the reason of baldness.
Because of deficiency of thyroid the hair start falling by becoming thin , weak and dry.
Along with keeping the body healthy with nutritious food the hair can also be made beautiful dense and strong.
Unbalanced diet not just stops the continuous growth of hair but it also makes bald very fast.
Because of any ups and downs happening in the life hair start falling and complete baldness may also come.
During pregnancy and after pregnancy the falling of hair in women is a common thing.
Tiredness and tension are the chief causes of heart disease so it also has a large impact on body and hair.
Some professions also do not stay away from affecting the hair.
The hair of a thirty year old man in England was found to come out in bunches while his hew hair were also growing.
After the chemical tests it was found that the quantity of mercury was more in his blood vessels because of which his hair used to fall.
It was found after enquiring that mercury was used in the industry in which he was working because of which the mercury slowly diffused into his body gradually.
Because of eating habits the hair often falls.
Because of excessive feelings and being emotional disorders occur in the head and it is natural for the hair to fall.
Increase of weight or obesity is a chief health problem.
Most men-women , be it adults or youth , are tensed with the increasing obesity or increase in weight of their body.
If the increase in weight and obesity becomes a hindrance for the activities of the body then actually it becomes a matter of concern for every person.
Normally , the main symptom of obesity is that the height of the body should be in proportion to the weight of the body.
If the weight is more than the physical height then the body is fat otherwise the body comes in the category of being thin.
Two main reasons of weight and obesity have been told under the health science.
First , genetic meaning by descent.
Second , because of food habits meaning activities related to diet.
Eating more than hunger , not doing exercise or physical labor , leading a life of lethargic etc.come under this.
People who do not do physical labor and exercise , along with the less flow of blood in their body , in places like belly , hips and waist.
Cholesterol fat accumulates in the blood carrying vessels as a result of which diseases like high blood pressure , indigestion , heart disease and diabetes occur.
At present as the consciousness of people are increasing towards healthy life and pure and plain healthy diet and exercise people are becoming aware of the dangers owing to increase in weight and obesity.
The diseases owing to obesity are also becoming a subject of concern for people.
Advice of reducing weight and obesity is given by the doctors to the patients of high blood pressure , diabetes and heart disease.
The women escape from food which increase weight and obesity and practice self control in order to keep their body slim and attractive.
It is generally seen that in order to reduce the weight of the body and not to let obesity come the lasses take very less food under dieting and do unnecessary exercise.
By doing unnecessary exercise several times harmful effects are seen on the body.
The other problem which comes by this is that if the weight of the body is more or less than required then along with ill effects on health weakness may also arise in the body.
In the report released by World Health Organisation , it was indicated in 2002 that among the ten chief dangers for health the biggest danger is that of the reduced weight.
If the weight of the body reduces without dieting or without exercise then this also is considered to be the symptom of a serious disease.
It is important to take the advice of the doctor prior to dieting.
It is essential for the body to get complete nutrition according to the daily needs because of which it can work well and there should not be any weakness.
The following matters have to be paid attention to in this context.
The harmony between food and habits is a must then only the effort towards the direction of reducing weight  obesity becomes meaningful.
The body construction and the food related needs of every human being is different according to his actions.
Copying someone or comparing oneself with the other is waste.
Some food items like fast  junk food , fried substances come under the food of negative calorie.
The hunger does get satiated by eating food items like fast  junk food.
But the body does not get any benefit from this.
Gradually one should try to evade it by strong will power.
Dieting is done by several girls and women to reduce their obesity and weight.
Positive results of reducing obesity come forward.
The person who is dieting should diet after taking proper consultation.
There are many dangerous diseases in the present world - TB , Malaria , disease of heart , Cancer , Tension and HIV etc..
These diseases are more dangerous than SARS , These diseases have caused the death of more people in comparison to SARS.
Then also SARS has attracted the attention of more and more people.
There are many similarities and difficulties in SARS and other diseases.
It is important here that SARS has emerged as a new problem , this is a new disease which is non-curable.
SARS is spreading due to infection.
SARS today is the synonym of that disease which occurs due to corona virus.
Because of SARS disease the infected person gets high 104 degree Fahrenheit fever.
Dry cough starts coming and there is difficulty in breathing.
SARS is called hyper active respiratory syndrome.
The initial symptoms of SARS resemble pneumonia.
But if SARS is not diagnosed in time or there is carelessness in treatment then death takes place.
The history of SARS is not very old.
The recognition of the disease was done for the first time in China.
The first patient was discovered in aeroplane on February 26 , 2003.
The symptoms of the patient infected with SARS are illusionary.
The infected person gets fever of 104 degree Fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this.
Headache and vomiting starts happening.
Breathing becomes difficult in the patient.
The symptoms like pneumonia appear.
The one who is attacked dies in three - six days.
In the whole world there is a situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of SARS.
Thus , Suspect Case and Probable Case have been defined.
The formula to stay constantly healthy.
Uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere.
By the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body.
At times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or cough-cold or any other disease or allergy.
With food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body.
Such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach.
If by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food.
After all why does it happen that in similar situations some people fall sick while some other people continue to be healthy.
How does the immune system work ?.
At first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents.
A type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes.
The nature protects us by other means as well.
Our mouth , nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes.
The saliva in the mouth is antibacterial.
A layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs.
The microbes which do not die immediately , they become inactive on sticking with the mucous.
There is a type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called ` lysosome '.
Lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria.
The beneficial bacteria named ` lactobacillus ' staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes.
This way our immunity works as a protective shield against the mischief of just any disease causing microbe.
If by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria , virus , fungus , parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins.
The scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system.
The cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body.
The cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity.
There are three main types of cells - red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes , white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is , the cells which coagulate the blood.
Worm - this is a common disease in children.
Objectively the worms are of several types - round worm , magnetic worm , thread worm , tape worm and other diseases of worm.
Round worm affects children the most.
The symptoms of round worm.
Less hunger , stomach pain , mild fever , chattering of teeth , micturition in bed , cough , itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms.
At times the round worms come together as a unit and produce obstruction in the intestines.
Because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting.
The hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there.
The eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood.
The round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing.
The eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body.
Tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat.
Their diagnosis is possible by stool examination.
Similarly , naru is also a type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds , lakes , tanks etc..
The water in rural areas is generally available from these sources only.
Thus , naru disease is generally found more in rural population.
The naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the Cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow.
The worm generally produces a wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water.
In such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water.
The symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body.
The part of the body where the worms come out , there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then a hole forms.
Because of this the symptoms of high fever , headache and vomiting appear.
In order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks , lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering.
The diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow.
The disease which spread through the microbes related to water -.
In this disease several types of malaria , filaria , dengue and yellow fever etc.are included.
The disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through a total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum , plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria.
In the symptoms of malaria there is high fever , nausea , headache and very profuse sweating.
By affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death.
Generally the mosquitoes bite at night.
The disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night.
Dengue , yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys.
Aedes Aegypti mosquito spreads yellow fever mainly in the urban regions by communicating virus from one person to the body of another person.
In the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate , fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water.
But its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run.
Or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite.
This nitrite again reacts with diamine , amide and carbonate and forms n-nitroso compound which is very cancerous.
For the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important.
On consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water , many types of disease occur in man and cattle.
The disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called ` fluorosis '.
Polio eradication program : problem and solution.
Polio is such a disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life.
In this disease affecting in childhood generally , the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin.
Consequently polio infested person has to walk as a lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life.
Often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further.
The reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus.
In order to free India from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year , the pulse polio program was started by the World Health Organisation which was established in April 7 1948.
The pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in Delhi in 1994-95.
Being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in Delhi this program was executed in the whole country in 1995-96.
Till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country.
The main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places , desert places , forest areas or in any far distanced places.
The pulse polio program will continue for three more years now.
As a result of the comprehensive mission for the eradication of polio in 1998 the number of new cases in the whole country has only been 1934.
Even after that because of the continuing pulse polio program the number of new cases in 1999 came down to 1126.
In 2000 this number had reached to 265 and by October 2001 only 100 new cases came within the grasp of polio.
At the same time in 2001 there were only six such states where new cases of polio were witnessed.
Out of these more in Uttar Pradesh 82 cases and after that 13 cases in Bihar had come forward.
The government had organised the pulse polio vaccination day only twice in 2001 but due to the increase of the number of polio cases to 1630 now the polio vaccination is being done 6 times.
Till May 10th , 2003 whatever cases were registered for polio in the whole country , the maximum 24 out of them were found Uttar Pradesh and 23 were found in Bengal.
Apart from these 8 in Bihar , 7 in Madhya Pradesh , 4 in Rajasthan and 3 in Delhi are included.
By August 21 , 2004 a total of 34 cases had come forward in the country , out of which 20 were of Uttar Pradesh , 7 of Bihar , 2 of Maharashtra and one case each of Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Delhi , Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.
The government had aimed to eradicate polio from the country by 2007.
On September 6 , 2007 a case of 11 month old girl has come forward in Jabalpur.
There has been increase in the type of P3 polio and P1 type of polio has also not been destroyed from the roots.
In 2007 1,389 cases were registered in the whole world out of which 864 cases were found in India.
It is known that because of the increase of the cases of polio in India , it has to face criticism from those countries of the world who have eradicated the disease of polio within them.
According to the Ministry of the Centre for Family Welfare the virus of polio has now become limited to some selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Because the virus of polio is found only in the body of human beings its complete eradication is possible.
For this in order to ascertain the abundance of substances antibody to fight against polio in human body dose of two drops of sobin vaccine is given through mouth and the dose of Salk vaccine is given through injection under polio immunity vaccine.
India is a country of huge population.
70 percent population of the country stays in rural areas where the health services present are of extremely low standard.
This is the reason that the infant mortality rate is very high in India.
Although the reasons for infant mortality are various and different.
Pulse Polio Mission is a national health safety child mission under the Family Welfare department of Indian Government in which in order to keep children of less than 5 years polio free medicine is made to drink free of cost.
The main purpose of pulse polio mission is to make the children free from physical handicap.
The main base of this mission is to make the pulse polio mission reach to every house and giving the medicine vaccine to each child up to 5 years.
For which the Indian government makes the mass aware through the medium of advertisement.
Pulse Polio Mission is actually a team work in which there is equal contribution of each member.
According to the survey of the World Health Organisation more than 15 crore people fall ill due to malaria every year and more than 50 lac patients die.
Malaria epidemic is a contagious disease.
Malaria spreads from mosquito named female anopheles.
Mosquitoes are omnipresent and diseases like dengue , chickengunia and filaria eliphantiasis also occur from these.
In malaria disease fever comes following chills and also following sweating.
10 -14 days after the biting of the mosquito the symptoms become visible and the person falls sick.
Because of being an infectious disease it can also occur from one person to the other person.
Apart from chill there is also vomiting in malaria.
There is intense headache in malaria.
The patient may even die if the treatment is not done immediately , because by this the fever rises up to 106 degree Fahrenheit.
After the infection there is lack of blood in the body of the person and the liver and spleen grow large.
Abortion may also occur in pregnant women due to malaria.
Female anopheles mosquito lays its eggs in stagnant water like ponds , lakes , wells , rivers , drains etc..
These eggs are very small and they keep floating on the surface of the water.
Generally , the eggs and the larva which come out of the eggs thereafter get a place to hide behind the grass or the plants by the side of water.
Larva comes out of the egg in 24-28 hours of the laying of eggs.
Larva gets converted to pupa in 5-6 days , which start taking dips in water.
In 2 or 3 days it flies away becoming an adult mosquito from pupa.
Adult mosquito rests at 45 degree angle from the surface.
This way while becoming mosquitoes from egg their enemy is gambusia fish which eats their eggs in the state of larva , pupa.
Tank kept open on the terrace near the house , useless thrown tyres , cooler , kitchen garden , fountains for decoration , pots and vases , broken vessels , uncovered vessels , disposable glasses , stagnant water near hand pump or tap , wells which are not brought into use , cistern of animals , the stagnant water in the paddy fields , the accumulated watering the monsoon season in the tantrum of the trees , the lakes surrounded with grass , marshy land and the stagnant water of the drains are the shelter place of the mosquitoes.
Malaria is an omnipresent problem.
There is no permanent solution to malaria and neither have the doctors of the world discovered its any inoculation.
Still for safety against mosquitoes you may get mosquito proof nets fixed on the windows and doors of your house.
Certainly put mosquito net while sleeping at night.
Put the repellent cream on the uncovered parts of the body.
In the evening burn the smoke of the leaves of need or the incense stick which drives the mosquito away.
Wear such clothes on body by which the whole body remains covered.
Least number of mosquitoes will bite by this.
In order to stop the breeding of mosquitoes do not let the water accumulate near the house , change the water of the cooler every week.
Do not let water accumulate in the broken vessels kept on the terrace.
Certainly put Gambusia fish in ponds , wells and lakes.
At the onset of malaria fever get the patient 's blood tested.
High blood pressure is dangerous for health -.
Blood pressure is not such an illness that can not be controlled.
By adopting a course of abstinence and medicines it is possible to prevent the serious consequences of blood pressure.
Blood pumped from left chamber of the heart circulates in the arteries spread throughout the body and it is the very pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries by blood circulation which is called blood pressure.
The pressure generating in the systolic shrinking stage of heart is called systolic blood pressure and the pressure generating in the diastolic expanding stage of the heart , diastolic blood pressure.
The systolic blood pressure in a normal person is less than 140 m.m.and the diastolic blood pressure is less than 90 m.m.of mercury.
Blood pressure of a normal man should be less than 140  90.
We call it increasing situation of systolic blood pressure on systolic blood pressure going above 140 m.m.mercury and increasing situation of diastolic blood pressure on it going above 90 m.m.mercury.
In any person either of the two blood pressures the systolic or diastolic can mount up or both the blood pressures can increase together.
These are all named high blood pressure.
For the health of a person it is necessary for his blood pressure to be normal.
There is pressure on heart as blood pressure mounts up and also there is adverse effect of it on the different parts of body.
Whenever there is decrease or increase in the pumping capacity of heart , there is a defect in valve of the heart , blockage in the main arteries emerging from the heart or vessels have contracted in the whole artery system and blood circulation is abnormal , then blood pressure starts mounting up.
Hormones oozing from some special endocrinal glands in the body also play an important role in the blood pressure increase.
Blood pressure also increases in case of disease in kidneys or their veins.
Such blood pressures are called renal blood pressure.
Though blood pressure can occur to anyone in any stage - children , youth , middle aged or aged , but generally disease of high blood pressure occurs more in individuals above 40 years of age.
In the last 2-3 decades changes brought about in lifestyle , food habits , a stressful lifestyle and a luxurious lifestyle which is increasingly becoming so on a daily basis have played an important role in increasing high blood pressure.
Get these tests done in case of high blood pressure.
The general test of blood and urine.
Test of lipid profile.
The test of blood urea and creatinine.
Test of blood sugar.
Test of serum protein.
Test of E.C.G.and heart.
Diet of high blood pressure patients :.
Patients of high blood pressure should never use alcohol , cigarettes , tobacco , paan masalas.
Patients of high blood pressure should use less salt in eatables.
Patients of high blood pressure should not use much fat in food.
For patients of high blood pressure mustard oil is a good option.
Patients of high blood pressure should consume fibrous eatables and green vegetables more in their food.
Instead of tensed , hectic , and tiring lifestyle patient of high blood pressure should adopt satisfactory system and must complete night sleep of 6 - 8 hours regularly.
Patients of high blood pressure should do light exercise on a regular basis or should develop a habit of strolling and walking for 30-40 minutes in the pure environment of morning.
A collective feeling emerges in the patients of high blood pressure by contributing in the small domestic chores and the need for labor also gets fulfilled.
Medicines for high blood pressure :.
In the modern medical world best of the best medicines of high blood pressure are available but their use should be done with advice of the doctor.
Generally after blood pressure is controlled people stop taking medicines but doing this is meddling with health.
Medicines of high blood pressure should be decreased - increased or stopped with the advice of an expert only.
Sound sleep , balanced nutritious diet , daily routine , and light exercise play an important role in controlling high blood pressure.
The ` fast food culture ' growing in children and in the family is contributing a lot in promoting high blood pressure.
There is need of control on the high blood pressure increasing - ' fast food culture.'.
Causes of high blood pressure -.
Obesity : there is chance of high B.P.in more fat people.
Use of salt : use of much salt boosts high blood pressure.
Some other elements : Potassium , Calcium , Magnesium , etc.are also some such elements that play their part in blood pressure.
Saturated fat : Its excess is an accessory to high blood pressure.
Wine : the use of it increases blood pressure.
Environmental pressure also encourages high blood pressure.
Contraceptive pills : An accessory to high blood pressure.
Genetic factor may also be a cause for blood pressure.
Harms of high blood pressure -.
Problems like heart attack , heart failure may occur due to high blood pressure.
Problems like kidney disease and kidney failure may occur due to high blood pressure.
Due to high blood pressure there is bad impact on the sensitive and important parts of body , among which the eye and the brain are mainly included.
There could be an ill effect of high blood pressure on retina of the eye and disease like paralysis may also occur.
Diabetes : Appropriate lifestyle can also prevent from diabetes.
Diabetes occur due to increase in the amount of sugar in the body.
After being sick in diabetes its effect also befalls on other parts of our body with which other diseases also emerge.
On being afflicted with diabetes the amount of glucose in blood increases more than necessary.
In case of natural activity of insulin formation being closed in the body of the diseased person or the effect of its activity not occurring on the cells , parts of the body and tissues can not use glucose easily.
Entry of glucose is facilitated in the cells of human body through insulin and cells can use this glucose for energy and this glucose is made in the pancreas situated in the stomach.
Circulation of glucose in blood happens through the liver by which tissues like brain , muscles and fat are discharged.
On being afflicted with diabetes either insulin is produced in a very small amount in the body or its effect on our blood cells does n't occur in a suitable amount.
Diabetes has two prototypes :.
Type 1 Diabetes : which occurs chiefly in children and in less than 20 years of age.
In this the insulin factory shuts down and the need of insulin arises for the child afflicted with disease to stay alive.
Type 2 diabetes : This happens due to a person 's irregular lifestyle of which carelessness in diet , to keep sitting , body being bulky are main.
In fact , regular exercise in lifestyle , change in food habits , and by losing weight , danger of diabetes can be stopped.
By bringing a change in food habits and loss in weight , prevention of heart diseases related to diabetes can also be done.
In the treatment of diabetes , to follow food habits related remedies is very important.
In a situation of not complying with advice related to food habits , any amount of insulin or medicines can not help.
Generally , in the meals of Indians carbohydrates and vegetarian content is more in amount and use of fish is also done among the people of coastal region.
If still a prey to diabetes then the reason is this that they do n't have the right information about their diet.
For appropriate food habits or for preparation of a proper diet chart a diabetic patient should consult a dietician.
Gradually decrease the amount of calorie intake in food , better still reduce 500 calories every 3 weeks and how long can you continue decreasing it also depends on your body weight.
Prepare a ` food chart ' in which include small and moderate diet.
Diabetic patients should consume minimum cuisines of oil.
Reduce quantity of sugar , fats and salt as well.
If you are vegetarian then increase the amount of fibrous food content in your food.
If you are a non-vegetarian then consume plentiful fish , and completely avoid vanaspati ghee.
Reduce the use of cooking oils also.
In organic fruits and vegetables quantity of anti-oxidants and minerals are more , which are beneficial for health.
Fish is also a great source of fatty acids.
Stop consumption of alcohol because by this also amount of sucrose in blood increases in a horrible manner.
Risks for diabetes :.
Family history of diabetes.
Increased body weight.
Weight of body should be according to body height.
By sitting around much also , weight increases.
Malnourishment in childhood  less body weight with birth.
Harmful effects of diabetes :.
Obesity , hyper lipidemia , high blood pressure , heart related diseases , stomach protruding out , increase in waist or hip size is also harmful.
Exercise : To keep the body fit and fine sugar should be used as less as possible and diabetes should be kept in control.
Walking around for 20-20 minutes at a fast pace at least thrice in a week is good.
Also remember this that exercising more than necessary can also cause harm.
Prostrate enlargement , a common problem of the middle aged -.
In people above the age of 50 years problem of B.P.H.is a common case.
For the treatment of B.P.H., in a new method of surgery T.U.R.P., neither a cut is needed to be made in the stomach nor does the patient has to stay in hospital for many days.
Prostrate gland made of muscles has a composition exactly like that of the shape of a shirt and surrounds the urinary passage like a collar.
In the prostrate gland milk like white fluid substance is made which is carrier of sperms.
With increase in age itself the size of prostrate gland also starts increasing.
The increased state of the prostrate gland is called B.P.H.
Although it is a natural condition of increasing age it is still a disease , which can affect our life and with which physical and mental problems both can happen to the patient.
In B.P.H.disease repeated urge to urinate is a common symptom so its reason is that prostrate gland is very close to the urinary bladder and stays surrounding the urinary passage.
When size of prostrate gland increases , its pressure is also exerted on the urinary passage due to which urinary passage contracts and becomes thin and small.
As a result , urine is able to come out easily and patient starts facing problems while urination.
Symptoms of B.P.H.disease :.
Because of swelling in prostrate gland and its increase in size two kinds of problems happen in urination.
One , difficulty to urinate due to pressure in the line of flow of urine and second , due to contraction in urinary passage and accumulation of urine an infection happens in it.
After that there is swelling in the wall of the urinary bladder.
Due to these complications a variety of difficulties start happening to the patient.
Like repeated urge to defecate urine , urge to urinate at night , effort while urinating at start and not only this urinating drop by drop and having pain while urinating.
The complaint of pain occurs when there is infection in urine.
Because of this complaint of stoppage of urine also occurs and relief is felt only when rubber tube is applied to take out urine.
In this type of patient there is difficulty to completely empty the bag of urine and after urinating also some amount of urine remains in the bag.
Treatment of B.P.H.disease :.
If much enlargement has not happened in the size of the prostrate then to do the treatment neither medicine is needed nor surgery.
In B.P.H.advice of drinking less water while sleeping at night is given.
If there is a habit of drinking alcohol then advice of leaving it is given.
Not only this , patient is also given advice to leave tea , coffee , etc..
If after this also the patient does n't get relief then medicine is given to reduce action of muscles of prostrate gland.
T.U.R.P : New method of surgery.
Nowadays treatment of prostrate is being done by many new methods whose names are , T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.And T.U.R.P.
T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.and T.U.R.P.there is no similarity in results in treatment through all three , that is why all are not popular together in these.
Nowadays T.U.V.P are not in use.
On the other hand treatment of prostrate through the use of laser beams is being considered the first choice of therapists.
In the treatment of prostrate T.U.R.P is quite popular and most urologists are using this method.
This is the reason that T.U.R.P.is called gold standard procedure.
After 72 hours discharge is given to the patient and only after a rest of 2-3 days patient can do his daily work.
In T.U.R.P method a telescope is made to enter through the urinary passage , and prostrate is seen through the help of a light and lens attached to it.
In T.U.R.P.method telescope stays attached to a video system.
There are many advantages of surgery by T.U.R.P.Method.
In surgery by T.U.R.P.method patient is given discharge from the hospital after 24 to 72 hours.
In surgery by T.U.R.P.method , necessity of making a cut in the stomach of patient is not needed.
In surgery by T.U.R.P method because of less time of the patient 's staying admitted chances of infection become quite reduced.
During surgery by T.U.R.P method there is less bleeding.
In surgery by T.U.R.P method patient recovers after only 2 to 3 days.
On treatment of prostrate by T.U.R.P.method , after a few days there is a complaint of clot of blood coming in urine of patient many times.
The complaint of appearance of clot of blood is a common problem which can be seen in a surgery of this kind.
This happens due to rupture of small blood vessels during surgery.
Secretion increases on blood pressure increasing extremely , getting a fit of cough or in a state of excessive infection.
Many times this problem is seen years after surgery also.
If there is a mistake in detection of disease because of some reason then after later on it is prostrate cancer and its surgery is done.
In such a situation the part of place of surgery becomes stiff like stone.
The turning of the part of place of surgery becoming stiff like stone occurs because of cancer having spread reaching into the third stage.
When the growth of cancer reaches the fourth stage then it also takes the bones in its embrace.
The other problem of this surgery is that of the flow of urine becoming reduced.
To get rid of this problem therapist puts a rubber tube in the urinary passage of the patient that helps urinate.
After a few days tension in it goes away on its own because of the tube.
Increasing havoc of Asthma in childhood.
Asthma is a form of allergy.
In this the ultrasensitive breathing tubes contract on coming in contact with allergy-causing elements.
The chest muscles have to work more hard on breathing in and breathing out during respiration through contracted breathing tubes.
Due to this sound of whistle starts coming from chest.
Due to swelling in the mucous membrane of breathing tubes and increase in secretion of its glands problems like cough and phlegm also happen.
Due to contraction of breathing tubes in children during asthma , they have more distress as compared to elders.
The breathing tubes of children are thin and capacity of lungs is less.
In some children the symptoms of allergy start reducing on increase in age and they become healthy by the age of 4-5 years.
In some older children other than viral asthma attack can occur due to sensitivity towards smoke , tobacco smoke , cold , sun , etc.also.
In other children asthma attack can happen due to laughing and crying.
Gradually these children can become sensitive to dust , animal skin , fiber strands , hair , body waste etc.and on coming in contact with these asthma attack can occur.
At nearly around 20 years of age allergy is produced by pollen grain to these sensitive individuals.
In some children attack occurs due to some specific food matter.
The main causes of asthma -.
To an extent allergy and asthma are also hereditary.

In the field of athletics when an infected individual gets wounded and if his blood somehow comes in contact with the blood of a healthy person then it spreads very easily.
It also spreads exceedingly among those who consume drugs via needle.
If an applied syringe taken from an infected person is used by another person then virus goes in the healthy person.
When someone in man and woman is infected with Hepatitis B and they have unprotected sexual intercourse then by this also the virus goes in the healthy person.
The way virus of AIDS spreads that way virus of Hepatitis B also spreads.
Even 1 part of blood of a person infected with Hepatitis B is capable of spreading Hepatitis B.
Hepatitis B is more dangerous than AIDS can be reckoned by this fact that the number of people that die because of Hepatitis B in 1 day is same as the number of people that die with the infection of AIDS in a year.
In India healthy person is also infected with Hepatitis B.
In many individuals despite being Hepatitis B positive they do not have the knowledge that they have Hepatitis B because this virus is unable to affect that individual too much.

On this Earth most developed is the very human mind which thinks for sure but it is given consequence by ` spinal cord ' only.
In body role of spinal cord safe in the backbone is like an electric wire , like on pressing a switch bulb turns on.
but electricity reaches the bulb through the wire only.
Just like this , in getting every job finished , role of spinal cord is foremost.
Spine happens to be the base of the whole body and rest of the bones are joined to each other like the ends of a staff.
Back bone not being straight like a staff is made of 33 vertebrae and between every two vertebrae there is a disc.
At the posterior side of back bone there are many tiny joints.
It is these discs and joints that impart the ability to the back bone , that we can bend on all four sides.

To escape from backache however modern technique of operation is available in country but there is no better treatment than precaution.
In our spine between every two vertebra there is a thin , flexible membrane or cushion which is called an inter-vertebra disc.
By this flexibility comes in spine and it works like a spring.
Many times due to imbalance in muscles else by suddenly picking up weight or by suddenly bending the body , the part in the inner side of the intervertebral disc which is very soft , by shifting , comes towards the hole between two vertebrae.
By this pressure is exerted on the nerves there and pain is felt anywhere from waist to leg.
Tingling and weakness is felt in legs.

But now by VAT surgery it has become possible to treat these diseases very easily by cutting and ripping.
What are the common diseases of thoracic spine ? 
In thoracic spine like neck and waist all diseases are possible , like slip disc , tumor , infection like T.B., fracture , hunchback , etc.

Why do lymph nodes enlarge in stomach ? 
Ordinarily lymph nodes are found in the stomach of all individuals but when they increase inside the stomach then there are many reasons behind their enlargement.
These lymph nodes of stomach enlarge due to T.B.disease also.
Their own cancer in lymph nodes which is called Lymphoma , because of that also they can enlarge.
Other than lymph node one more cancer is also there which is called Hodgkin 's disease , or in some other part of body if cancer is occurring then lymph nodes enlarge in the stomach.

If in the gall bladder there is some ordinary common defect then it is removed out of the body.
Patient can lead a normal life but if cancer is in its first stage.
If cancer on increasing reaches the lymph nodes then it is a late stage of cancer , and in this attempts can also be made to save the patient.

Heart of human is of four chambers meaning ` left-right auricles ' and ` left-right ventricles '.
Between auricles and ventricles special ` valves ' have been made which in reality do the work of gatekeeper.
The valve of the left side is called ` mitral ' and valve of right side is called ` tricuspid '.
From these blood can go from auricle to ventricle only and can not come back up because by then they are closed.
This way at the meeting point of ventricles and main blood-carriers also these valves of the shape of half moon give permission to blood to circulate in the whole body through the medium of the main blood-carriers.
Blood is not able to return back into the heart because by that time these valves shut.
After all what is the necessity of blood circulation every moment ? 
Medical literature says that by complete blood circulation 1200 cc Oxygen is received by every cell that is successful in giving only 5 minutes of life to them , hence it is necessary for blood circulation to get activated again.
The blood carriers that take pure blood to all cells are called arteries.
Veins ' is name of those blood-carriers that collect blood from all over the body and do the job of returning it back to the heart.
Hence there is no exaggeration of this condition that our heart is greater and more efficient than any human made instrument.

While finishing daily chores of life , while coughing or sneezing , laughing , while picking up stuff by bending sudden leakage of urine is called S.U.I., that is , stress urinary incontinence.
The specialists of International Urology Association have to say that an individual 's muscles and connective tissue which are a support of Urethra , do not remain so capable to be able to support the Urethra.
Then automatically the problem of leakage of urine arises.
Other than this when sphincter , that works like a valve , during pressure is not able to stay shut then also urine leaks out in some amount.
In Indian women there are around 2.2 crore cases of S.U.I.that do not come forward due to lack of awareness and hesitation related to the disease.

According to body ratio people with much weight and patients of terminal obesity have more danger of S.U.I.
After menopause estrogen level decreases and due to this when there is pressure on Urethra chances of S.U.I.increase.
After menopause weight of women also starts increasing and this becomes the accessorial reason behind occurrence of the disease.
Hysterectomy : Due to surgery of uterus also muscles of pelvis can get injured.
Side effect of medicines : S.U.I.can happen by adverse effect medicines to control blood pressure or anti-depressants and sleeping pills also.
In the options for treatment of S.U.I.medication and surgery both are included.
In which anti depressant medicines duloxetine or imipramine are to be taken and paseries use of removable medical apparatus which can be fitted in the vagina has to be used.
Bladder neck suspension like M.M.K.Marshall Marchetti Krantz and brush suspension have to be made use of , bulking agents like hydrogen injection periurethral injection have to be applied , etc.

Dr.Minocha of Batra Hospital has to say that ' actually our skin has three layers - epidermis , dermis and subcutaneous.'.
The outermost layer which is visible to us , it is called epidermis.
The middle layer is called dermis and the innermost layer is called epidermis.
Dermis has flexibility and the protein and moisture in it helps in preventing wrinkles.
With advancement in age the flexibility and moisture in dermis starts reducing by which the layer becomes thin and is not able to send moisture to the outer layer.
The result of which are wrinkles.
According to beauty expert Arti Sharma , after the age of 30 years women should be cautions towards wrinkles.
If from beginning some things are kept in mind then for many years wrinkles can be averted.
In order to stay protected against wrinkles do not stay in direct light of sun for very long.
Especially the ultra violet rays of the sun from 10 o ' clock in the morning till evening become the biggest cause of wrinkles.
While going out in sun , swimming or in the field of sports , make use of sun - protection cream.
Abstain from smoking.
Smoking absorbs the precious moisture of skin because of which wrinkles form before time.
Daily massage your skin with hydrating cream or moisturiser especially when the air is dry.
By applying excessive cream on face the pores get closed because of which the sweat does not come out profusely and becomes the reason for prickly heat and wrinkles.
If yoga is done then one can stay safe from wrinkles for quite long time.
If with other precautions you practice yoga then till 55 years of age the wrinkles will not appear.

Due to osteoporosis the bones become weak and start breaking gradually by becoming brittle.
Osteoporosis is a disease which occurs because of deficiency of calcium and Vitamin D.
Maximum women come to know about this when there is any fracture in their bones and the bones do not join easily.
Generally the women of advanced age get affected more by osteoporosis , the level of estrogen decreases because of menopause.
Apart from this , not doing physical labor after menopause and the deficiency of Vitamin d and calcium in diet are the chief causes of osteoporosis.
If you suspect osteoporosis then get X - ray done immediately.
For the test of X-ray the use of technique named dexa is used.
By the technique named dexa status of fracture in bone at present is found out.
In order to escape from osteoporosis after menopause increase the quantity of calcium in your diet and exercise regularly.
Thyroid is that gland of the body which controls the physical activities.
Because of hyper activity of thyroid gland the quantity of thyroid hormone starts increasing.
If thyroid gland is hypoactive then the quantity of thyroid hormone is less than required.
Both these conditions are signals of the thyroid disease.
Generally the women are affected with hyper thyroid.
The detection of thyroid is very easy.
India was the first country in which the national program for blindness prevention was started in 1970 after detecting the comprehensiveness of the deficiency of Vitamin A.
Short term and long term solutions have been included in this national program.
The plan for long term solutions have been made for making Vitamin A rich food materials abundant and to encourage their food.
On the other hand in order to prevent blindness and to avoid the other ill effects of deficiency of Vitamin A the heavy dose of Vitamin A to children from 6 months to 5 years is a short term solution.
National nutrition Organisation , Hyderabad reviewed this national program in 1978.
In order to achieve the desired result from the program it has been found that it is important to make the related health workers and those running the program more aware together with the immense cooperation of people of the community.
The department of health and family welfare formed a task force in 1989 to prepare the principles to rectify the execution of the Vitamin A program and to clarify the ways of the work.
Under this effort a booklet has been prepared for the health workers and those who are running the program.
In the program of national prevention of disease against the blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A it is important to make the working staff of program more aware together with immense cooperation of the people of the community.
The problem of the deficiency of Vitamin A.
In the developing countries the deficiency of Vitamin A has been identified as a chief problem occurring due to the deficiency of nutrition and control over it can be achieved.
The role of Vitamin A in the prevention of blindness due to lack of nutrition is very well known.
According to a vague estimation the eye sight of around 30 - 40 thousand children may be lost due to deficiency of Vitamin A.
By getting Vitamin A in huge quantity blindness occurring due to lack of nutrition can be prevented.
Vitamin A has a very huge hand in correcting the health of children and reducing their mortality rate.
Till now there is no clear knowledge as to how Vitamin A does such vital works.
It has been noticed in Indonesia that the children in whom there is deficiency of Vitamin A , in them the danger of onset of dysentery and the grave type of infection related to respiration increases by 2 to 3 times.
Death of around 50 percent children in India is due to dysentery and the diseases related to respiratory diseases.
Because of measles the quantity of accumulated Vitamin A in the body decreases.
Because of the heavy fall in quantity of Vitamin A the danger of chances of other diseases increase.
These diseases are pneumonia , onset of dysentery and dry eye discharge xerophthalmia.
Every year thousands of children die due to measles and other complications occurring because of it.
Apart from this the cornea of the eye is damaged due to this and the child may also become blind.
The deficiency of Vitamin A - why and how ? 
The deficiency of Vitamin A gives rise to xerophthalmia that is , the disease of dry eye discharge the drying up of eye.
In xerophthalmia the outermost layer of the pupil , that is , conjunctiva and after that the layer below the conjunctiva , cornea , dries up.
Due to the damage of cornea after this the eye sight is lost.
When the accumulated Vitamin A in body finishes and the quantity of Vitamin A received by body through daily food is less than required then xerophthalmia occurs.
Xerophthalmia occurs due to these reasons.
Xerophthalmia occurs due to the reduced consumption of less food rich in Vitamin A everyday.
Xerophthalmia occurs due to the error in transmission of the absorbed retinol to the right place in the body and the fast depletion of the accumulated Vitamin in the body.
The deficiency of food materials rich in Vitamin , the reduction of the quantity of Vitamin A accumulated in the body are the chief causes of xerophthalmia.
The absorption of Vitamin A in the children victims of dysentery , respiration related infections , measles , diseases of stomach and intestines decreases and its need to the body increases.
As a result of this a cabal of infections starts.
Because of the deficiency of Vitamin a the power of the body to fight with the infections is reduced.
Due to infection the health of the child goes on deteriorating.
Eye related signals and symptoms -.
Although the deficiency of Vitamin A affects many organs but its worst effect is seen on the eyes because of which eye sight is constantly lost.
The surface of the cornea becomes dry and rough which later on ruptures partially or completely.
Wound develops because of this in the cornea.
The damage to eyes is such due to the wound in the cornea that it is permanent , that is , it can never become alright.
The eye sight goes by this.
Eye related symptoms are the most trustworthy measure to identify the deficiency of Vitamin A.
In the serious condition of disease the grave symptoms may become visible early.
It is not essential that mild symptoms before order and grave symptoms later on are visible.
The detection of the signs and symptoms of xerophthalmia.
Night blindness : the first symptom of xerophthalmia.
In night blindness the child can not see after darkness or things kept near him in the room.
Bitata stains - although there could be difference in the shape , place and design of the bitata stains but they are similar in appearance.
Bitata stains are formed due to the accumulation of frothy substance on conjunctiva.
If disease of keratomalacia is not treated then cornea at the place of wound may get permanently damaged.
Due to keratomalacia a hole may occur in the cornea.
In the condition of hole in cornea the damage would never be corrected.
The sooner the treatment of keratomalacia is done the smaller would be the wound and the damage of cornea.
If the treatment is done fast then the damage of the cornea and the blindness occurring due to it can be completely prevented.
India was the first country which had implemented a national level program to prevent blindness occurring in children of less than 5 years due to the deficiency of Vitamin A.
In order to prevent blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A , a national disease prevention program was started in 1970.
Initially the prevention program was started in those seven states where the problem was more serious.
By 1975 the disease prevention program was implemented in the entire country in the form of a national program.
At present the national disease prevention program is being run amidst 3 crore children less than 5 years of age.
The help of two principles is being taken in implementation of the national disease prevention program.
In the short term principle heavy dose of Vitamin A is given time to time to children less than 5 years of age.
The danger of blindness due to the deficiency of Vitamin A is the maximum in the children less than five years of age.
At first the age of pre school children 1 to 5 years was included in this program.
Now by giving an extension to this program children of 6 - 11 months are also being included.
Together with this there is the proposal to give priority to children from 6 months to 3 years.
Giving extra dose of Vitamin A in addition from time to time is effective and safe.
On giving the dose of Vitamin A in limited quantity its ill effects are negligible.
At times the effects of headache and vomiting are seen but they are seldom and common.
The prevention of blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A -.
The decided dose of Vitamin A is as follows -.
Children of 6-11 months : giving the dose 1,00,000 I.U.
The time of the inoculation of measles is a good time to give the dose of Vitamin A.
Children of 1-5 years : The dose of 2,00,000 IU every 6 months.
The treatment of children affected with the deficiency of Vitamin A.
On the identification of deficiency of Vitamin A all children affected with this must be immediately given the dose of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A.
One to four weeks after this second dose of 2,00,000 I.U.of Vitamin A should be given.
In order to avoid the occurrence of the deficiency of Vitamin A again the regular intake of Vitamin A rich food items like green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables of yellow pulp should be encouraged.
Children who are suffering from dysentery , intense respiratory infection , an eye must be kept carefully on them.
Such children must be administered the normal dose of Vitamin A.
For the national program the solution of Vitamin A comes in the form of a fragrant syrup in bottle of 100 millilitre.
The quantity of Vitamin A in syrup is 1,00,000 I.U.per millilitre.
With each bottle there is also a spoon of 2 ml measurement with it.
By consuming the syrup by filling up to the mark on spoon the determined quantity of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A is obtained.
In order to keep Vitamin A there is no need of any special type of arrangement like the cold series.
Then also Vitamin A should be kept in dark and cold room protected from sunlight.
After opening the bottle all its solution must be used within 6 - 8 weeks.
On not opening the bottle , the solution of Vitamin A in the bottle stays safe when kept in dark and cold place for around one year.
The cost of 100ml of the bottle of the syrup is around rupees 25.00 or the cost of one dose of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A is around 50 paise.
The solution of Vitamin A is given free to the community through the medium of primary health center.
Apart from this , capsule of the determined dose of Vitamin A 1,00,000 IU comes for the infant kids as well.
By cutting one end of the capsule with scissors or clean blade all the content filled in it must be squeezed in the mouth of the infant baby.
Vitamin A syrup is obtained from the ministry of health and family welfare.
On the basis of the probable number of the beneficiaries the children from 6 months to 5 years of age the medical officer of the primary health center should put a demand for the required quantity of Vitamin A.
The maternal and child health department of health and family welfare department is that central department which has the complete responsibility of the implementation of program.
The program is implemented by the primary health center and sub center in the rural areas under the guidance of medical officers.
The medical officer of the primary health center is in charge of getting Vitamin A , administering dose of Vitamin A to children and guiding the program.
The responsibility of administering dose to children in primary health centres is on assistant health nurses ANM and on other paramedical workers.
Comprehensive immunity inoculation program provides an opportunity of coming in contact with the newborn babies.
The contact happening with the newborn babies of 9 - 12 months for the inoculation of measles is the best time for giving the first dose of Vitamin A 1,00,000 IU.
Intensive Children Development Service ICDS program provides opportunity to give Vitamin A to children of 6 months to 5 years of age.
Not only should Aanganbari workers help in identifying needy children but they should also help in administering Vitamin A dose and health education to areas where ICDS program is running.
By his fifth birthday the child should get nine doses of Vitamin A in total.
In order to keep track of the Vitamin A dose being given to the children of less than two years the mother-child security card should be brought into use.
Under the ICDS program vigilance is kept on all the children of up to 6 years so that the use of their growth vigilance card is behavioural.
Lack of Vitamin A in food and lack of accumulated Vitamin A in the body are chief reasons of xerophthalmia.
In children of pre - school age lack of Vitamin A and carotene the initial form of Vitamin A in the daily diet is the chief reason of tension.
The amount of Vitamin A and carotene in the diet of children have been found less than half of the daily proposed quantity of 400 gram retinol or 1600 microgram of beta - carotene.
The absorption of Vitamin A decreases in children suffering from dysentery , breathing infections , stomach related diseases , measles and other diseases.
In the lack and prevention of Vitamin A help may be got in the control and prevention of malnutrition through immunity , proper nutrition , oral rehydration and timely treatment.
The last resort in the prevention of the lack of Vitamin A is the regular consumption of Food items rich with Vitamin A.
The food items rich with Vitamin A Are cheap as well as locally available.
The getting of Vitamin A should be ascertained right from the time of birth.
Along with the feeding of colostrum or milk the milk that is secreted from the mother ' s breast immediately after the birth of child the need of Vitamin A would be fulfilled during the first six months of breast feeding of the child.
Between the age of four to six months initiating giving abundantly Vitamin A rich food is very essential.
The food items included in this are green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables consisting of yellow pulp carrot , Capsicum , gourd , papaya , mango and sweet potato.
The quantity of Vitamin A received from 100 grams of edible part in maximum green leafy vegetables is more than the daily received dose of Vitamin A prescribed for the diet of Indian children.
After cooking this much of vegetable is reduced to only two tablespoonful.
Along with the other food items a child can eat this much of vegetable easily.
This way he can easily fulfil his daily need of Vitamin A.
The inclusion of other food items rich in Vitamin A apart from green leafy vegetables like dairy products milk , cheese , curd , butter liver , eggs , ghee and oil should also be encouraged.
Such habits related to diet put a stop on the lack of Vitamin A.
The consumption of green leafy vegetables and other food items rich with vitamin A everyday during pregnancy and breast feeding is advised.
Because of the state of Vitamin A in the body of the mother the quantity of Vitamin A in the mother ' s milk and by that the health of the child is affected.
Because of the consumption of food materials rich in vitamin A in abundant quantity during pregnancy and breast feeding there is never a lack of Vitamin A in both mother and child.
Nutrition education is an integral part of primary health services and ICDS program and under this emphasis must be given on the encouragement of the use of food items highly rich in Vitamin A.
The ultimate solution to the problem is implicit in providing education of eating food items rich in Vitamin A to people.
The consumption of regular and sufficient quantity of Vitamin A in the children of preschool age and pregnant and breast feeding women should be ascertained.
The implementation of the national program in effective manner.
The program can be implemented effectively only with the help of trained workers and the rise of community awareness of high level.
The training must be given to the entire team providing health services and the workers of ICDS program.
The workers of both the areas will be benefitted by this in playing their responsibility in the implementation of the program in effective manner.
The following matters must be paid attention to while training.
The effect of the deficiency of Vitamin A..
The recording of the signs and symptoms of the lack of Vitamin A.
The identification of people receiving dose of Vitamin A.
Along with getting Vitamin A the treatment of lack and stopping of Vitamin A by giving heavy dose of Vitamin A.
The reduction and stopping of the lack of Vitamin A by encouraging the consumption of food items rich in Vitamin A available at local level.The effective methods of special message and communication.
The encouragement of community participation.
The technique of recording and the method of reporting.
The lack of Vitamin A is the chief health problem of the mass among the children of preschool age in India.
According to a rough estimate 30 to 40 thousand children become victims of preventable blindness every year.
The danger of infections in children increases because of lack of Vitamin A and the chances of their falling sick and dying also possibly increases.
The benefit received from Vitamin A complex makes the national disease prevention program stop the blindness occurring due to lack of Vitamin A very widely effective.
The officers of health and ICDS program and the controllers of these programs can play the role effective support in saving the eye sight of crores of children and improving their life.
Under the National Disease Prevention Programme implemented against the blindness happening due to the lack of Vitamin A 3 crore children below the age of five years are being benefitted at this time.
Under this program two chief principles are being adopted.
One is short term principle and the second is log term principle.
Under the first principle the arrangement of administering heavy dose to children between the age of 6 months and 5 years has been done.
Under the second plan emphasis is given on getting more vitamin through the medium of vitamin A rich food materials like green leafy vegetables , yellow vegetables and fruits , regular consumption of dairy products and breastfeeding.
Encouragement is given on consumption more quantity of vitamin A rich food materials which are cheap and which are also available regionally and on educating the children because this is the last solution to stop the deficiency of Vitamin A.
The mobile phones of hospital staff become home of diseases.
The mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern life style may become the reason for the spreading of disease.
This fact has come forward in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of MGM hospital situated in Washi here.
More than 82 percent workers of hospitals are found to be the careers of microbes and organisms of contagious diseases in a study.
The doubt of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , pimples , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases are in this.
According to the study done by the Indian Medical Research Council the test of 120 mobile phones of the workers were done.
The researcher final year student of MBBS of MGM medical college Dr.Nikhil Tambe has found that such organisms and microbes have been found on 99 phones , which along with making the disease of the patient serious may also become the reason of delay in his getting well.
Tambe has said that the maximum number of presence of microbes has been found in phones of the technicians.
After this the mobile phones of ward , nurse and then doctor were infected.
The chief of the microbiology department of the hospital Dr.Chitra said that the maximum 54.6 percent stacillococcus acurus organisms have been found on the mobiles , which become the reason of skin disease.
Apart from this the organisms like e - coli and pseudomonas have also been found because of whose infection the ill effect on the body is maximum.
In one of the studies done in Coimbatore the presence of 96.2 percent organisms was found on the phone of the hospital workers.
Sprouted cauliflower may protect from the cancer of stomach.
This fact has come up from one of the studies that by eating germinated cauliflower three days early keeps you miles away from stomach cancer , gastritis and ulcer.
Sprouted cauliflower destroys the microbes which give rise to these diseases.
According to the published study in the General Prevention Research of the American Association for Cancer Research situated in America by eating 70 gram quantity of germinated cauliflower regularly three days before finishes the effect of the organism named helicobacter pylori H.pylori.
H.pylori microbe is the maximum reason of the diseases related to stomach and the cancer of stomach.
Jade Fahe , the research associate of the faculty of the department of medicine science of the John Hopkins School of Medicine has said that it has been found from the study that with germinated cauliflower not only in animals but in man also it is capable of stopping cancer.
According to the study , the researchers selected a few from the 48 Japanese suffering from the helicobacter microbes and they were fed 70 grams of sprouted cauliflower for eight weeks and some were fed sprouted Alfa.
In the beginning of the study on these people the effect of these organisms was studied after four to eight weeks following it through various tests.
After eight weeks it was found less , however the effect of the microbes on the ones feeding on Alfa was fond to be the same.
New oral vaccine has been prepared for diarrhoea.
The National Institute of Disease , NICD Kolkata did test on 70 thousand people.
The cost of the dose of oral vaccine would be 40 - 50 rupees.
To prevent diarrhoea the chances of the oral vaccine to come early to the market has increased manifold.
The National Institute of Intric Disease has completed the successful test on around 70 thousand people.
70 percent cases have come positive in the test.
Although around one year of time may be required for the oral vaccine to come in the market.
The cost of the dose of the medicine may be between 40 to 50 rupees.
Not only in India but diarrhoea has become a serious problem also of the whole world.
Despite this there was no vaccine for the treatment of diarrhoea.
But after the untiring efforts of hundreds of researchers success has been achieved in the preparation of one more vaccine.
International Vaccine Institute Korea has manufactured this medicine.
To escape from the Indian market a national company has bought this formula.
The cost of this medicine would be one dollar per dose and any person would have to take two doses of it.
The effect of medicine will stay for two years.
In Vietnam the dose of vaccine has already been given to 90 lakh people and in Kolkata , India the trial has been done on 70 thousand people , in which the accuracy of the medicine has been found to be 70 percent.
In the program specialists from World Health Organisation , National Institute of Cholera and Intrinsic Disease Kolkata , ICMR , Department of Biotechnology of the Central Government and International Vaccine Institute Korea.
The experts have told that the first to prevent diarrhoea is oral vaccine.
Its maximum benefit would be in Orissa , West Bengal along with the people living in other coastal regions of the country and on international level Africa , Australia and people residing in the coastal areas in other countries , because the number of cases registered here is maximum.
Though this medicine can not be administered to children who are less than one year of age.
According to the figures of World Health Organisation the total number of case registered for cholera was one lac 77 thousand in the whole world and 4 thousand 31 people died because of this.
Because of unavailability of any vaccine to prevent this disease one has to depend only on the methods of precautions.
According to the World Health Organisation the effect of diarrhoea is seen more in coastal areas like Orissa , West Bengal , Gujarat and metropolitans like Delhi and Mumbai.
How can the diagnosis and treatment of cancer be done ? 
Many times due to less information or carelessness the diagnosis of breast cancer is done late.
If you stay a little attentive then the treatment of breast cancer is possible timely.
Be cautious towards your body and get investigated by the doctor from time to time then riddance from breast cancer can be obtained easily.
If tumor is felt in breasts together with growth in the arm pits then be cautious.
Mild pain and swelling is felt on that place because of the growth of tumor.
Change comes in the breasts or their size.
At times wound appears on the place of swelling and then blood secretion starts from there.
When the tumor is on the upper and outer surface of the breast and there is secretion from the breast then immediately contact the doctor in such situation.
The tumor appears hard and there is no pain in it on touching.
The women who are more than thirty years of age should certainly themselves inspect their breasts once monthly seven days after the menstruation.
The stages of breast cancer are believed to be four.
But as the spreading of the wound increases its treatment becomes difficult.
In the fourth stage also if its treatment is done then success is achieved in 50 percent cases.
In the first and second stage the treatment is cent percent possible.
In the first stage the size of the tumor is less than two centimetres.
The tumor of two centimetres is not visible in any part of theory.
In the second stage the tumor grows to two to five centimetres big.
This reaches to the neighbouring gland of colourless fluid.
In the third stage the tumor grows to five cm and spreads to the skin and muscles of the body but does not reach up to the neighbouring gland.
In the fourth and very dangerous stage the tumor can be of any size.
The tumors do get affected by this and it also spreads to the other parts of the body.
As first surgery is done on the area with pain and then it is diagnosed that how big is the spread.
The conclusion may be wrong at the clinical stage but at the surgical stage the condition becomes very clear.
After the age of forty years the women should certainly get the mammography done.
In one mammography the expenditure comes to one thousand rupees.
Do not hesitate at all in getting mammography done.
Discuss about this , tell this to the members of the family and accumulate new information.
The treatment of breast cancer is expensive , which comes to one lac rupees.
But many charitable institutes are such which help immensely in this to the person.
Many help line services are also available for the treatment of breast cancer.
the treatment of cancer depends upon the age of the patient , the shape and spreading of the tumor formed in the breast.
Maximum women have to undergo surgery following which they are advised for anti cancer drug or hormone therapy.
Some women are advised for radiotherapy after the surgery so that the cancer is eliminated from the roots.
After the age of forty get mammogram done regularly or else do the inspection of your breast yourself after consulting the doctor.
If there is any type of tumor in the breast then immediately contact the doctor.
All the tumors are not cancerous but showing precaution is important.
If there is discharge of blood from the breast then immediately show to the doctor.
In the grown situation of the cancer the breast has to be removed partially or completely.
At present in place of the severed breast fake breast can be implanted through surgery.
The creation of breast is done with the tissues of the muscles of the patients only.

In the initial two three days the milk which comes out from the mother 's breast is called colostrum.
The antibiotic obtained from the mother 's milk provides the child with the power to fight.

What is conception ? 
When the sperms of man meet with the ovum of woman then conception takes place.
But before this conception many situations are formed.
Firstly the sperms reach the uterus by going through the vaginal canal and enter the fallopian tube.
Here in the broad portion of the tube there is mating with the developed eggs which comes out of the ovary.
On entering the eggs sperms mix their chromosomes with the egg.
The egg gets fertilized and after developing gets converted into a multicelled ball which is called blastocyst.
This gets attached to the surface of the uterus.
The contact with the muscles of the tube and the cilia lining as thin as hair advance the egg towards uterus.
The egg does not advance on its own.
Every month many eggs are developed but in hair follicle only one egg is able to develop.
The other eggs get squeezed on their own.
Lakhs of sperms enter the uterus but maximum get destroyed due to the reason of the acidic substances inside.
One or two out of whatever sperms escape get attached to the outer layer of the egg and the moment conception takes place , it puts a ban on the entry of other sperms.
Following situations come in conception.
Sperms passes through the uterus and goes to the fallopian tube.
The egg enters the tube.
The sperm makes the egg conceive.
The zygote gets divided into two.
64 cells of zygote enter inside the uterus.
This gets converted into a seed.
On reaching its destination the seed gets connected with the surface of the uterus.
Here it gets nutritive substances from the blood cells of the mother.
Related to the menstrual cycle generally women have this misbelief that it is dirty blood and the more it flows out of the body the better it is.
But this is a very wrong misbelief.
Actually the reason of menstruation is the destruction of inner wall of skin inside the uterus , that is , the endometruim line.
The thinner this wall would be , that much less would be the flow of blood.
Because of excess flow there is a deficiency of iron elements in the body of the woman and the woman becomes victim of anemia.
Actually menstrual cycle is one such physical change in the body of women which comes entirely within the system of reproduction and is very important for reproduction.
The menstruation coming every month is the time between the onset of puberty and menarche.
During the menstrual cycle from the body of fully mature woman during ovulation ovum is released , with this the lining of uterus , endometrium develops that time only.
After ovulation this lining prepares the reproduced egg and conception takes place.
If conception does not take place then a new menstrual cycle starts.
This is the part of the endometrium and blood products which comes through the passage of vagina.
Generally the menstrual cycle is of 28 days.
It has three phases - in first phase menstruation from 1 up to 5 days.
In the second phase the hormone cycle from 6 up to 13 days.
The third phase suitable for reproduction 14 to 28.
Before the start of menstruation many changes in the hormones take place , whose maximum effect is seen on the behavior of the women , like the increase of irritation , some stiffness in breast , increase of weight , swelling etc.
Because of the reason of the bursting of ovarian cyst many times there is sudden pain in abdomen.
Many times blood also starts flowing heavily , the reason of occurrence of both these complications together is soreness in genitals.
But there is no need to panic in this because these diseases become alright easily by proper treatment.
Generally there is a misbelief that four days prior to menstruation , four days of menstruation and four days after menstruation are very safe , but this is possible only when your menstruation is regular.
The second method is that everyday the woman takes her temperature and notes that in a diary.
The day on which temperature rises by one degree then believe that egg has been produced this day.
Five days before and after this day are said to be unsafe.
By recording the temperature for three - four months the woman can easily get to know her unsafe days easily.
Various methods are present for contraception , you have to choose according to your ease.
Because of not using the methods of contraception children are born one after the other and by becoming victim of malnutrition go to the embraces of death.
In the entire world death of around 60 thousand children takes place , out of this 99 percent deaths occur only in developing countries.
The mother and child should stay healthy and fit and proper gap should be there between two children , for all these it is important that methods of contraception should be used.
For men condom is very cheap and is a simple option and it also saves them from many infections.
There should be knowledge of the method of its proper use.
Apart from this because of this the woman has to depend completely on the man.
After discharging instead of putting the semen in the woman ' s vagina he throws it outside.
Though it is a good and free of cost option , but because of this the danger of conception is maintained without interruption.
In the process of vasectomy also that passage is closed without incision through which the sperms flow.
What is to be understood is that only the passage is closed.
This is a small work of 15 minutes.
By coming on his own the person can go back home on his own.
After vasectomy he can do his daily work as usual.
In vasectomy one precaution has to be taken , for the next three months while doing intercourse condom has to be used.
After vasectomy on the interval of one month and then in the third month coming for the doctoral test is important and after the doctoral report intercourse can be done without any tension without any condom.
But for this men do not agree easily.
The options for contraception for women -.
Women can use pills , cream , jelly , sponge etc.which are put in the genitals so that semen can not go inside.
The pills are put some minutes before intercourse or on need may be put one hour before.
During six hours if intercourse is done again then it is important to put the tablet again in the genital.
Copper T is a good option , these are of several types.
Copper T 200 - this may be put for three years.
Copper T 380 A - this may be put for ten years.
Multiload copper T 250 and 375 - this may be put for five years.
By this technique semen may be stopped from coming inside.
But get the copper T fixed only when there is no pregnancy.
As menstruation starts or as it ends you may get it fixed.
After getting the copper T fixed there is no need to use any other contraceptive option at all.
After getting the copper T fixed get the doctoral check up done certainly in the interval of one month and then three months and then every six months.
In market some emergency contraceptive pills are available.
These are such pills which are taken in emergency that is then when conception takes place by mistake.
These should be taken between 72 hours of conception.
After this take five days morning - evening.
Taking two pills immediately during conception morning - evening and two pills 12 hours after pregnancy the risk of pregnancy is averted.
When the family is completely planned , then through surgery also women may get rid of pregnancy forever.
This is done in two ways - first through telescope and second by cutting the stomach slightly.
By telescope the fallopian tube is either tied or destroyed.
By incising the stomach also this process may be done.
Both these processes are painless and hundred percent successful contraceptives.
At our place since long intercourse is done by calculating the days which is considered a successful contraceptive option to a great extent.
Apart from this regular and uninterrupted breast feeding is also considered to be a good contraceptive.
In today ' s modern world though there are options one after the other like condom , pills which are kept in the genitals , copper T , etc , but the most effective options are contraceptive pills.
Contraceptive pills are those pills which are eaten which women find the most comforting.
In modern times Karl Deresy is considered to be the genitor of contraceptive pills.
These pills on going to the body of the female stop the female from conceiving.
Because of pills no new eggs are formed in the body of the female.
In the contraceptive pills of yesteryears the quantity of estrogen and progesterone used to be very high which had several ill effects.
But in modern pills there is no such danger.
These pills provide cent percent protection to the woman.
By this the menstrual cycle becomes regular.
The pain and blood flow occurring these days also reduces by which the complaint of anemia does not occur.
Apart from this , protection from the tumor of the breast etc.also takes place.
In 1970 some sort of reduction in the level of hormone had been brought.
After this its as if the standard of contraceptive pills have started improving.
Today these pills have only been considered to be the best contraceptives.
Some times back from now there used to be 21 days and 28 days course of contraceptive pills.
For 21 days one pill only had to be taken daily according to fixed time.
Now the pill to be taken once a week has also come.
These contraceptive pills are easily available in the market which may be bought from any chemist.
These pills may be bought from any medical store.
Related information is attached with these contraceptive pills.
Obesity does not only make the personality unattractive , it even attracts many diseases.
How should be the lifestyle for staying fit ? 
No one wants that there should be useless fat on his body but due to carelessness in lifestyle weight starts increasing and many types of diseases start surrounding.
Today piling up of fat on body is a universal problem.
It should in fact be said that in case of obesity India is slowly on path of America.
Here obesity is given the status of disease.
Here every third person is victim of obesity.
If said in the language of the doctors , then any person becomes obese when in comparison to the calorie used by him he consumes calorie in more quantity through the medium of food and other food materials.
This imbalance in the consumed and used calorie may arise due to various reasons.
Now this depends on the particular person that which reason is responsible for him becoming fat.
Obesity may also happen due to hereditary reasons.
Although this is also a fact that the food habits and life style of some families are the ones which increase obesity.
But despite this , it has been proved in researches that somewhere the biological makeup of human body is also responsible for obesity.
Especially for adopted children it has already been proved that there is much closeness in their weight and the weight of their real parents in comparison to the weight of their adopted parents.
Environmental reasons also become a cause for obesity.
In this the lifestyle and food related habits are included.
What any person eats and how much he is involved in physical activity , it has a direct relation with his health , especially the weight of the body.
If he does not burn the calorie received through food , then extra calorie starts accumulating in his body in the form of fat.
And lastly the result is the person becoming victim of obesity.
Today people eat a lot of fast food and fried things but save their skin from labor.
At homes modern instruments are present for the help of women , then children keep sitting in front of TV , computer for hours.
Not only this their mouth is always full with chips , chocolates and other market things.
On the other hand seven - eight hours of a day of office going women - men are spent sitting on the chair.
What is meant by saying is that the opportunities for man to be included in physical activities are becoming less and less and the consequences are in front.
Even the smell of food makes the person obese.
Many times even when there is no hunger he comes towards the food attracted with the smell and in return he gets more calorie than the required.
Psychological reasons also become the cause of obesity.
On being mentally unhealthy also there is tendency of man to eat more.
Especially , on being victim of tension , sadness , anger or inferiority complex not only do the people eat more , but at regular intervals they also get the urge to eat something or the other.
This way they not only receive calorie in high quantity but by repeated eating the eaten food also does not get digested and the rate of their digestion the rate of the consumption of energy becomes disrupted.
In such situation it becomes a difficult task for them to get rid of obesity.
But it is seen up to the extent that the enthusiasm towards life in the person disturbed mentally diminishes.
And in such situation he becomes depressed towards keeping himself fit or to reduce obesity.
The diseases occurring due to obesity.
Heart attack , sugar type B , stone in gall bladder , high blood pressure etc.
many types of cancer like cancer of intestine and prostrate in men , then the cancer of reproductive organs , uterus , ovary , breast and gall bladder etc.
The disease of joints , the disease of liver , sleep apnia that is obstruction in breathing for some moments during sleep.
In women the irregularity of menstruation and infertility etc happen.
Some special types of diseases also make the body of the person fatty.
Hypothyroidism , depression , consumption of steroids or anti - depressant medicines are some such situations , when fat starts building up on the body of the person.
In women they have seen to become fat especially on the occurrence of the complication of thyroid or after the surgery of uterus.
Similarly after delivery also they become fat in an abnormal way.
Although their weight starts increasing during pregnancy , but this is the stage of overweight , not that the quantity of fat starts increasing on the body.
While after giving birth to the child fat only increases on their body , gaining control over which is many times beyond their limits.
Often the meaning of obesity for people is the increase of weight , but this is not the right definition of obesity.
According to medical experts , in the increased weight the weight of everything like muscles , bones , fat and water are included.
While with obesity the meaning is - accumulation of fat in body in proportion higher than a certain quantity.
That is the direct relation of obesity is with fat , not with the increased weight of the body.
Like if we consider body builders and athletes then their weight is very high.
Despite this body builders and athletes are not fat.
Body builders and athletes are stay absolutely fit and healthy.
But this does not mean at all that fat is bad every ways.
It is important that in every human being there should be fat in certain quantity for storage of energy in the body , for the maintenance of enough heat , to bear the shocks from outside or to other such important works.
You are fat or whether you are fat or not , to know this it is important to know BMI or body mass index.
The easy way to know BMI is - BMI = weight  height square meter.
If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9 , then it is considered that the weight of the person is more , while people with BMI of 30 or more than 30 are called obese.
Though BMI is incapable of saying this that in a person the quantity of fat is more or that of muscles , bones , fat , and water etc.
Then also with its help the quantity of fat can be estimated to a very great extent.
To know this together with the weight of the person his height in square meter is also needed and in height all the organs of the person are included to a very great extent.
There is no alternative to exercise in reducing obesity , But if you feel that strolling morning - evening is exercise then it is completely wrong.
With exercise the meaning is - to bring the heart rate to the level of 75 percent to its rate after doing exercise for 20 to 60 minutes.
Like if your age is 40 years , then your desired heartbeat rate is 220 - 40 = 180.
Your level of exercise is its 75 percent , that is it should be 135 par minute.
For this anything in cycling , jogging , aerobics may be included in the daily routine.
Together with this do yogay , also meditation , but while doing exercise you must keep certain thing in mind.
Certainly do ` warm up ' five minutes before exercise and ` cool up ' after it.
For heart patients walking fast , jogging or brisk walking are the best exercise , but if their has been a heart attack recently or there has been a bypass surgery , then definitely take the advice of the doctor before exercising.
With this keep in mind the following things in the daily routine -.
Increase the duration of exercise gradually.
take deep breaths while exercising , but pay attention not to stop breathing.
keep at least an interval of one hour between meal and exercise.
Do not exercise when you are sad , in tension or angry.
Adopt controlled lifestyle.
Smoking , drinking , mental tension fuel the fire , therefore escape from them.
If you are suffering from some psychological disorder or the disorder of overeating , then contact the psychologist or psychiatrist in time.
Because of more than required weight , children are becoming victims of the diseases which occur in adults.
Increasing obesity in children ahs come up in the form a serious problem.
Children are becoming victims of diseases like diabetes.
It has become very important to control obesity.
doctors believe that the treatment of obesity should be done in childhood only.
Because due to obesity on growing up diseases like heart problem , diabetes and high blood pressure start cropping up.
In maximum children the complaint of obesity is seen in the age of 2 - 5 years.
During this time the weight of children is more than their age , the chance of whose reduction diminish with increasing age.
In countries like India increasing urbanisation and globalisation have pit a deep impact on the food habits of children.
Today children relish the fun of TV , video game , DVD and other electronic gadgets for hours , because of which their sports have reduced.
Also with this the consumption of junk food has also increased in children , the cholesterol , and sugar which are found in them only become the main reason in increasing the quantity of calorie in the body.
Because of the reason of these junk food only around 10 to 20 percent children in India become the victims of obesity.
By 2030 approximately half of the children of the country will come in the clutches of this disease.
In a survey done recently this thing has come up that in the last 50 years the consumption of oily substances in Indian children has increased 20 percent.
In children eating candy , chocolate , pizza , hotdog , French fries and sweets the number of children in the age from 11 to 20 years is told to be around 80 percent , there the number of children from 9 - 11 years is told to be approximately 25 percent.
First a ban should be imposed on the canteens in the schools of children which sell junk food.
Apart from this at home mother - father should pay special attention on the food habits of children , by which they eat fibrous fruits and vegetables in more quantity leaving the fatty food.
The government of every country should put a prohibition on the advertisements of junk food that are shown on the TV.
Especially that time when children are watching programs on the TV.
In every school the period of yoga , exercise and PT should certainly be organised because of which their outdoor activity increases.
Also with this it is important to highlight their performance in the report card of the children , by which they themselves also stay alert.
the moment the eye of any person falls on the increased fat of his body , then immediately his attention goes towards his food and he starts dieting.
While for reducing the quantity of fat the requirement is of balanced diet.
Therefore , firstly get your check up done , so that it is assured that the weight is not increasing because of any disease.
Get a diet chart made from the dietician according to your height , weight , age , sex and routine that how much calorie you should consume through your food daily.
For your convenience some suggestions to control calorie are like this.
keep an account of you food and physical activities.
Mind it that in return to the eaten things you have done labor.
If you like eating ice then eat it after taking out the rice water.
Drink at least two litres of water everyday.
Consume seasonal fruits - vegetables in more and more quantity and consume fruits - vegetables of dark color more and more quantity and certainly eat the fruits - vegetables of dark color but eat less sweet fruits.
Do not eat mango , banana , sapota and grapes.
Eat more salad and use sprouted pulses also in this.
Always eat thin dal and eat dal with peels moong dal , horse gram dal.
For chapatti instead of using flour of mill use thick flour made in millstone with the bran.
This mixture of cereals does not let fat increase on the body.
Bring in use toned milk and instead of curd bring in use curd water mixed with black salt and carom seeds.
For cooking bring in use such oil , in which there is less cholesterol like soya bean or oil of corn.
If there is desire to eat sweets then eat such sweets , in which there has been no use ghee like petha in place of gulab jamun.
Consume less and less of fast food , meat , ghee , oil maida , sugar and dry fruits.
Consume less salt.
The direct relation of obesity is with our food habits , but the important thing is ` right eating ' not ` less eating '.
The use of bypass surgery in the treatment of heart diseases is not very old.
This has proved to be a boon for the heart patients.
The obstruction created in the originating part of all the major arteries can be treated with bypass surgery.
Through the coronary angioplasty method a tube is made to reach the arteries of the heart through the medium of the starting point.
A balloon is fixed on this tube.
While putting the tube inside the balloon is deflated.
Studying the path of this tube on television it is taken to the place of obstruction.
Right at the pace of obstruction the balloon is inflated.
By this the obstruction in the arteries of the heart open up.
Then the tube is taken out.
There are many benefits of this method like less expenditure , no need of surgery , there is no danger of infection as well and even one does not have to stay in the hospital for more days.
But this technique can not be brought into use for all the patients.
In opening up blocked arteries E.C.P.proves fruitful.
E.C.P.external counter pulsation is one such technique through the medium of which the blocks occurring in the arteries can easily be removed.
The moment the obstruction of the arteries are removed the transmission of blood in the body increases.
In the medical process of E.C.P.a set of three soft strips compressive cuffs is tied on the knees , lower thighs , upper thighs and hips of the patient.
This soft strip keeps inflating and deflating regularly.
During this entire process these strips by putting pressure on thighs and hips increase the diastolic coronary perfusion pressure because of which reduction comes in the pressure exerted on the heart.
E.C.P.Treatment process is very simple and easy.
This treatment is given to the patient only for an hour.
In total this process continues for 35 hours in 7 weeks.
The patient is neither made unconscious during this nor any kind of medicine is given to him.
During the entire process of E.C.P.The patient feels very easy.
In the immediate diagnosis of heart attack apart from E.C.P.And some special tests of blood at present a special type of camera is brought into use.
By this camera how much part of the heart has been damaged , this can be known.
The destroyed muscles of the heart may be diagnosed with the help of gamma camera.
According to the heart specialists , immediately after heart attack more damage occurs in the heart by the accumulation of blood clots in the coronary arteries.
The clot of blood if accumulates on the upper part of the artery then the heart attack becomes serious.
Because in the upper part of the arteries only the flow of blood is more.
On the accumulation of blood clot in the lower part or the last part of the artery the heart attack does not become serious.
Due to the reasons of the newest technique of medical science removal of blood clots now has become very easy.
In the decade of eighties two injections were developed by the American medical scientists to remove these clots which are called ` streptochynas ' and ` urochynas '.
For the patients of heart these injections have proved to be a boon.
In the cardiac medical science this technique is known by the name of ` thrombocytic therapy '.
But today for the diagnosis of the diseases of the heart newer techniques better than the other are available.
The myth that after heart attack life becomes worthless , useless and meaningless has changed now very fast.
After becoming alright the patient may join their work.
The malfunctioning in the muscles of the heart may also be made alright like other diseases.
Rehabilitation is very important for the patients of the heart.
The meaning of rehabilitation is to make the patient capable of working again , removal of mental tension and making him able to lead normal life.
Often after heart attack mental tension and fear start bothering the patient.
For leading a normal life it is important to remove such apprehensions.
There are three important stages of rehabilitation.
In the first stage it is important to remove the fear of becoming incapable or death from the mind of the patient.
Also with this any kind of pressure exerted on the heart is tried to remove.
This is that stage when the patient is made healthy mentally.
The initiation of making the patient disease free completely takes place in the second stage.
In this the person comes out of the bed and also starts climbing up some stairs gradually and at the end he comes back.
The complete effort of the doctor is this that once again the patient becomes a healthy and active citizen of the society.
In the third stage it is tried to make the patient physically and mentally completely healthy.
In the SAAOL natural medication keep the heart disease free -.
Today the number of heart patients is increasing at a fast pace.
Medical science has also gone very far in this direction.
With techniques like angioplasty , bypass surgery the successful treatment of heart disease is possible.
But various research studies on the heart patients reveal that by taking slight precaution in one 's life pattern , style of living and food habits and by doing yoga and exercise the danger of many types of diseases may be averted.
the alternative of natural medication is beneficial.
the number of heart patients are increasing everyday.
People have to undergo expensive and risky surgeries.
At times one does not get much time between heart attack and heart fail that the patient may be saved depending on the doctor.
But bring such changes in the lifestyle that these types of complications do not come then it would be even better.
According to the verdict of Dr.Vimal Chhajed the director and the heart specialist of SAAOL heart center of Delhi the alternative of natural treatment is the most beneficial for the patients of heart.
After getting the important tests for coronary heart disease the advice for surgery is given to the patient.
Even after getting the surgery done the patients has to come to the hospital again after two - four years.
Even after such dangerous surgeries when the patient feels complications then the advice to consume the medicine by increasing its dose is given.
If the patient adopts the habit of staying continuously in neural and beautiful environment of nature and uses vegetarian food then the permanent diagnosis of these problems may happen.
Consume less oil and fat in food.
By doing yoga morning - evening , and doing sahaj exercise benefit is received.
Actually this is a natural treatment whose effect provides the body with the ability to make it free of all bodily diseases.
SAAOL that is , science and art of living , is a technique of treatment of heart based on natural treatment.
Under the SAAOL heart program the patents are not just given immediate relief but its permanent solution is done through natural medicine.
under the SAAOL natural treatment at first the importance of vegetarian food is told.
Then under SAAOL natural treatment habits of yoga in morning - evening and meditation etc are adopted.
In this treatment there is neither the need of eating medicine nor of getting surgery done.
Under this medication a training of three days is given to the heart patient.
The patients are kept in natural places away from the population.
During the training the habit of eating vegetarian food of less fat and to endure tension are taught.
Under this treatment along with yoga practice scientific information related to heart disease are also given.
That is , during this training the art of new balanced and natural life style is taught to the patient.
Balanced and fatless food and regular exercise become his daily routine.
Why is natural treatment esteemed ? 
We have made even more than two and half thousand heart patients disease free with this natural treatment method.
In comparison to the availability of many types treatment methods and new medicines in modern medical technique the natural treatment method is more fruitful and beneficial.
After getting the treatment done through the natural treatment technique the patient becomes completely disease free.
The special thing with natural treatment technique is this that the person adopts such habit that other diseases do not ever cross his path.
Those people who after taking the training of natural treatment technique continue following its rules , the danger of heart problems can never occur to them.

Handicapness in itself is a curse , either it is of limbs or mental.
It is very difficult to estimate the physical suffering , helplessness , worthlessness , negligence etc.Occurring due to handicapness.
Only those can know this whose children have become victims of dangerous diseases like paralysis polio unknowingly.
It is the primary duty of every mother - father to get the child injected with the vaccine of polio in order to save from handicapness.
Out of six dangerous diseases occurring in childhood is polio which is called ' baal pakshaghaat ' in Ayurveda.
Those children who get this disease , their mother - father do not know anything related to this from the beginning.
Objectively : by knowing its initial form - symptom and by maintaining caution we can save the child from being polio infested.
Child polio disease at first infects the digestive system.
Its viruses reach the intestine by entering in the digestive system through the nose and mouth.
Staying in the intestine they continue to grow.
Then these viruses after getting mixed with blood damage the nerve cells of the vertebral column on reaching the central nervous system.
As a result to this the disease of polio appears.
Although the chance of reaching these viruses to the brain is just one percent.
But that same one percent becomes the reason of polio in child.
In Ayurveda it is called shaishawiya pakshawadha , baal pakshaaghaat or adharaang - waat.
This means the upper or lower part of the body becoming inactive or sensation less.
No work can be performed from the polio infested part.
There remains no voluntary control over that part.
Polio is a quick developing contagious disease.
Polio occurs due to three types of polio viruses.
Which are called polio myelitis type polio myelitis virus type 1 , 2 , 3.
In human species the disease of polio occurs due to the first and third type of the viruses.
The polio viruses do not die quickly.
Polio spreads from one person to the other.
After the infection through the medium of stool or else mouth , the discharge of nose it spreads quickly in intestine and throat.
The entry of polio in body is through several media , getting hurt , injection , through tonsil , during surgery etc.
It has been seen such that in the last stage of pregnancy in a pregnant woman the chance of its infection is high.
The easiest medium of its infection is - drinking water , food , milk , eating with dirty hands , surrounding dirt etc.
Not just this the virus of polio spreads from one patient to the other patient also through coughing , sneezing and phlegm.
The beginning of polio is similar to the symptoms of influenza.
The attack of the disease of polio is often sudden.
In the beginning the child may get mild fever , after this there may be paralysis in the patient.
The incubation period of the disease of polio is considered to be 3 to 12 days.

Generally it is considered that the direct relation of heart diseases is with the increase in cholesterol.
As the quantity of cholesterol increases in body , the danger bell for heart gets rung.
But in modern experiments one such element has come to be known , which is considered to be far more lethal to the heart than the cholesterol.
This substance is - amino acid named homocystin which is four times more sticky substance than cholesterol.
This gets produced in the body during the process of digestion of food only without protein.
If its quantity gets increased in the body , then ill effects like blockage in the arteries , reduction in the work capacity of blood vessels have to be faced.
Apart from this because of the increase of homocystin alone many lethal effects have to be faced.

In this also the percentage of Indians with this problem is more.
In the blood of man 5 - 15 MOL  L homocystin should be there.
If homocystin is found even 5 percent more in man then the chance of heart attack increases three times.
Because of increase in homocystin the chances of death increases 50 percent due to disease of heart and 20 percent due to brain and neural diseases.
Therefore those people who have a family history of heart disease , for then getting the homocystin test may prove to be blessing.
The reasons for increase of homocystin is obesity , diabetes , high blood pressure , smoking etc.

Radha became worried , she remembered the saying of A.N.M.behanji that because of repeated dysentery the water of the body and the salts come out and there may even be danger to his life.
Immediately as per told by bahanji Radha started giving liquid items found in the house repeatedly to Muniya.
Like the water of dal , starch water of rice , lemonade or light tea.
But together with these things behanji had also asked to give O.R.S.but that there was no O.R.S.at home.
Sohan brought O.R.S.packet from anganwari.
Radha made O.R.S.solution according to the process told by A.N.M.bahanji.
And made Muniya drink after every dysentery.
Next day Radha threw the leftover solution and made fresh solution.
Apart from this she also continued feeding complete meal to Muniya.
In two - three days the dysentery stopped on its own and Muniya became alright.
Everyone should remember it always that as dysentery starts in child , keep giving domestic liquid things after every dysentery.
Deficiency of water in body is very dangerous , therefore keep giving O.R.S.solution as well.
At least give half bowl of food four - five times in a day certainly and even after this there is dysentery then take her to health center.
The treatment of cough - cold may be done even in the house.
Therefore on contracting cold Radha treated Muniya this way.
By making her drink tulsi tea , and mixing ginger juice and lemon juice in honey.
By giving more and more things to drink and by feeding regularly.
Muniya became alright in three - four days.
But Radha thought if her condition would have become worse even after doing everything.
Bahanji counselled that the meaning of such happening is pneumonia and there are three symptoms to recognize it stopping of food - drinks , fast breathing and rib movement.
In such situation take the child to bahanji immediately and get her administered the medicine of pneumonia.
If bahanji tells then immediately go to big hospital and get her checked up.
If due to any reason you do not find bahanji then also take the child to big hospital immediately.
Muniya did not even become of one year that mother - in - law started expressing the desire for a grandson.
Radha asked bahanji , she said that it will take two to three years for the weakness that has come in the body after the birth of Muniya to go away.
As such if there is pregnancy then there may be problem as well as complication and the prospective child may also stay weak.
Also Muniya will stop getting mother 's milk and her care will also not be taken.
Radha understood , the meaning of more and frequent children is disease in the destiny of child , malnutrition and twelve months of money crunch.
Bahanji told easy and reliable ways of contraception.
After discussion Sohan and Radha chose the right way and decided that for three years they would not produce second child.
You should also remember that there should be a gap of three years between two children.
Conception before three years is bad for the health of mother and child.
For keeping gap between two children use condom , pills or copper - T.
On stopping the these methods second child may be given birth to.
One day some people did a counsel after coming to the village , Radha and Sohan also went , the discussion happened regarding the stopping of disease through hygiene.
After toilet putting soil or ash over it.
After washing the hands properly only feeding the child and using clean water.
To protect food from dirt and flies.
Burning the garbage of the household or burying it in the ground.
Not letting water accumulate near well or hand pump.
Through all these things the prevention of diseases may happen to a great extent.
Everybody liked the talks and with the help of institution and panchayat people completed these together.
Sohan and Radha in fact even swore to ward off dirt and disease.
After some days the result also came in front , as dirt lessened the diseases too started reducing.
Diabetes has taken the form of an epidemic in the world and its various kinds of social and financial adverse effects are also coming forward.
In the patients of diabetes diabetes foot is an extremely serious problem.
Do you know that in the world every year the foot of 10 lakh patients has to be amputated because of diabetes foot ? 
Thus in the whole world in every 30 seconds surgery of amputating the foot of a certain patient afflicted with diabetes foot takes place.
My intention of telling you these figures is not to frighten you , but to caution you.
By researches done in this regard it has been proved that by good care it is possible to escape from the problem of diabetes foot to great extent.
Hence it is necessary that patients of diabetes should know this well what effect of this disease can occur on feet and how the care of feet should be taken.
The ancient proverb of Prevention is better than cure is absolutely successful in diabetes disease.
There is a chance of occurrence of ulcer in feet to the patients of diabetes due to the following two reasons.
In the patients of diabetes because of damage occurring in the nervous system there is decline in capability to feel in their feet and they do not feel pain at all due to which wound or injury in feet does not get detected in time.
In patients of diabetes because of flaccid blood circulation wounds or injuries heal late and on occurrence of a small wound danger of infection keeps lurking.
Such people whose blood level is high can suffer from diabetes foot.
అయితే ఒకవేళ మీకు ఎప్పుడైనా ఇలా తెలియజేయబడిందా మీకు మధుమేహం ఉందని లేదా మధుమేహం రావడానికి అవకాశం ఉన్నట్లైతే మీ కాళ్ళకు దెబ్బ తగలకుండా కాపాడాలి మరియు వాటికి మంచి పోషణ కూడా చేయాలి.
In patients of diabetes the likelihood of diabetes foot increases if you have diabetes neuropathy.
If blood circulation is flaccid in your feet.
If there is a deformity in your feet , like there is corn or hammer-toe in feet.
If you wear shoes of wrong shape or design.
If you are afflicted with uncontrolled blood sugar.
If you smoke beedi-cigarette , drink alcohol or your cholesterol level stays high.
If because of diabetes there has been ulcer in your feet ever before.
If because of diabetes you have disease of kidneys , heart or eyes.
The main causes of diabetes foot ulcer and infection in feet are :.
Due to bite of wrong sized or new shoes.
Wounds in feet like wounds occurred unknowingly by shoe bite or by walking barefoot those which patient is unable to detect.
Blisters occurred by burning like because of bath by extremely hot water , bottle of hot water , heat radiator , etc.
Infection of corn plaster and nails.
Wound occurred by continuously staying in bed of patient bed blisters.
Deformity in feet like kinak , clawed nail , corn , etc.
Care of diabetic patient and feet -.
In preventing diabetes the role of the patient himself is most important.
Patients should examine their feet everyday on a regular basis.
Patients should look at the upper and lower parts of their feet attentively everyday.
Patients should also examine the parts between their fingers and parts near the ankle close to heel regularly.
Patients should keep in mind if there is no wound , cut or pain anywhere while examining their feet regularly.
If there is no crack or cut in the skin of feet of patient.
If the skin of feet of patient is not dry or soft.
If there is no swelling in one foot or leg of the patient.
If there is no formation of warts or kinak in feet of patients.
Change in the nails growing on the inner side of fingers like nails getting thick or colourless is a sign of diabetes foot.
Occurrence of blisters on skin is also a sign of diabetes foot.
Occurrence of hot  cold spots on skin is a sign of diabetes foot.
To prevent diabetes foot keep an eye on changes in blood circulation.
Keep an eye on color of fingers also.
By your sitting on chair etc.on hanging your legs if color of fingers of your feet starts becoming red , pink or purple then blood circulation in your feet is not right.
Do not be indifferent to pain in feet.
If at night or by walking little you start feeling pain in legs then understand that blood circulation in a certain vessel is blocked.

Do not cut your nails quite deep rather cut straight.
If nails are left pointed then file them.

Everyday in the morning and before sleeping wash your feet with lukewarm water and use a moderate soap.
Before washing your feet kindly ensure that water is not extremely hot.
हलक्या रंगाच्या नरम वस्त्राने पाय पुसा तसेच बोटांच्यामध्ये लक्षपूर्वक पुसा जेणेकरून त्याठिकाणी त्वचा घासून सोलून जाता कामा नये.
After wiping your feet examine your feet carefully if there are no signs of blood of pus on it.
If you find signs of blood or pus then consult a therapist quickly.
After wiping apply talcum powder between feet and fingers so that there remains no wetness.
If because of a certain reason you have to keep your feet in water then do not keep for more than 2-3 minutes because by being in water for a long time skin of feet becomes extremely soft.
Foot spa ' may prove harmful for patients of diabetes especially who have disease related to neuropathy or pulse.
If your feet are getting dry then apply a cream so that there are no cracks.
Do not apply cream between fingers.
If feet are too dry then use cream twice a day.
Make a selection of your cream only on consulting a therapist because for extremely dry feet special cream , containing urea , is available.
Be careful that inside the house pointed things like needle , insulin syringe or pin etc.do not remain lying on the floor.
Patients of diabetes should not walk barefoot.
By walking barefoot there surely stays a chance of getting injured rather extreme pressure is also exerted on feet due to absence of support from shoes.
RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VM N_NN CC_CCD PSP N_NN N_NN RP_RPD N_NN CC_CCD V_VM N_NN JJ 
Examine your shoes and socks from time to time and before wearing shake it from top to bottom so that if there is a pointed thing , etc.it should come out.
Be careful that feet do not come in direct contact with things like bar heater or bottle of hot water because skin may burn by it.
To keep skin warm wear thick socks.
Once a year definitely get your feet examined by specialists of foot care podiatrist.
Patients of diabetes should maintain special caution about shoes.
Often chance of occurrence of ulcer increases by wearing new shoes.
If you buy new shoes then first see them wearing in the house for 20-30 minutes.
If shoes bite some part of your foot or exert extreme pressure then get the cobbler to loosen the shoe a bit else buy new shoes.
Never stay wearing a new shoe for the whole day.
RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VM RB PSP N_NN PSP N_NN CC_CCD V_VAUX N_NN 
Do not wear open slippers or sandals and do not wear shoes without socks.
Wear leather or vinyl-mesh mix shoes.
Shoes should be broad and open so that feet fit in properly.
Shoes should be of round toes.
The part that supports the heel of the shoe should be tough so that it does not become flat.
Tie the leather straps properly or wear the shoes by means of Velcro so that feet stay in a comfortable position.
The sole of shoes should be flexible and about 1 cm thick.
The interior of the shoes should be soft.
While buying shoes putting hand in the shoes check if the interior of the shoes is not rough.
Buy new shoes after noon because feet swell during the day.
Often shoes bought in the morning do not fit in the evening.
Prior to buying shoes in the evening take a measure of your foot on a cardboard thereafter buy new shoes on the basis of its measure.
It is said that ' to delay is better than an accident ' but by delaying in case of diabetes foot an accident may occur.
Therefore from today rather from now itself start taking care of your feet in the right manner because the best cure for diabetes is its prevention only.
Even then if the symptoms of diabetes foot are visible to the patient of diabetes in his feet then without delaying consult your therapist immediately.
Diabetes has taken the shape of an epidemic in the world today.

Today approximately 4 crore people are afflicted with diabetes in India and by 2030 there is a likelihood of this number reaching to 7.9 crores.
The main cause of disease of diabetes is a comfortable lifestyle , obesity and excess in population of old people.
Therefore we get to see the number of patients of diabetes more in cities as compared to villages.
There is an estimate that 30 % patients living in metropolitan cities do not know that they have come into the clutches of diabetes disease.
Comparatively with the Southern countries Indians are becoming prey to diabetes in youth itself.
Because of which there is a great harm to the economy also.
Diabetes is of two types , Type-I and Type-II , but in India 95 % patients are of Type-II only and only 5 % patients are found to be of Type-I.

In the condition before occurrence of diabetes pre-diabetic on examining blood on an empty stomach level of glucose increases and ' glucose tolerance ' becomes abnormal.
It is that condition when glucose in blood is more than normal but person can not be called a diabetes patient yet.
From ' pre-diabetic ' patients 5 - 10 % people come into category of diabetes each year.
This is a good news that prevention of diabetes is possible.

Researches tell that healthy diet less calorie , less fat-acidic and fiber in abundance and through regular exercise everyday 30 minutes and 5-7 times in a week diabetes can be reduced by 50 % in people of abnormal glucose tolerance.

In diabetes life threatening , large and minute complications can be born in the vessels.
To prevent these complications aid of heart vessel and pancreas transplant and laser photocoagulation can be taken.
Due to these chances of occurrence of blindness , disfigurement and premature death can be there.
Diabetes of pregnancy can prove to be harmful for mother and child both.
The complications of diabetes can be stopped from increasing.
It has been proven from both studies ` Diabetes control and complications trial ' in category-I diabetes and United Kingdom Prospective Category - II diabetes that it is possible to prevent minute vessel complications by intensive glucose control nevertheless through intensive glucose control controlling large vessel complications is not that significant.
Through blood pressure control , intensive lipid management and anti-platelet therapy these complications can be reduced in a significant manner.
These complications can be stopped in a significant manner by keeping a strict control on all these abnormal processes and expense that is incurred on the patient is also less.
Cure of diabetes and related complications is expensive.
An expense of about Rs.5000 can come every year on the treatment of a patient.
Cure can be more expensive if complications of patient increase else he has to be admitted to the hospital.
There is an expense of more than Rs.20,000 crore on the therapy of Indian diabetes patients.
A strict control on the glucose level of diabetes patient is difficult because the danger of occurrence of hypoglycemia in them can increase by it.
By new medicines like insulin analog , inhaled insulin , peptide-I exenatide like glucagon , meglitinide derivative , DPP-IV inhibitors control of level of glucose can be done without the danger of hypoglycemia.
Despite of being acquainted with advantages of strict control on glucose , blood pressure control and lipid control only 30-40 % patients are able to have this control and out of these also only 10 % patients are able to have control over all of these.
It is necessary to spread information about researches that happen on diabetes and control related cures on a massive level.
If diabetes and its complications are not stopped from taking a dreadful form then in a developing country like India catastrophic circumstances can originate.
Here even today we can not control the pathologies and mortality rate due to infectious diseases and prenatal diseases.
For this we will have to bring changes in lifestyle of common man.
We will have to examine people who have more danger of occurrence of diabetes , we will have to take more care of pre-diabetic patients , we will have to control the glucose level and we will have to control the blood pressure and lipid of diabetic patients.
Although doing this is extremely difficult but it is necessary to achieve these goals.

Currently number of diabetes patients in India is about 370 lakh.
There is a chance of this number increasing to become about 860 lakh in 2030.
There are a number of reasons behind cases of diabetes increasing suddenly in India.
Having congenital reasons , having much weight , imitation of western lifestyle , sensitivity , stomach fat and insulin resistance with less weight.
Diabetes can affect various body parts.
Nervous system , eyes , kidneys , bones , etc.also have not escaped this epidemic.
By diabetes disorders can occur in bones , joints and muscles and nerves.
Because of which stiffness in joints - swelling , ulcers in feet , decaying of feet else feet can become dark.
If proper control is not kept over diabetes then bone related diseases can occur.
If an elderly woman is afflicted with category - I diabetes then danger of bone breaking increases by it.
If bone breaks then it takes a long time for it to join.
In addition to this bones become basically weak because due to deficiency in insulin developmental process of bones stops.
This does not happen in category - II diabetes afflicted as most of the patients of this category are fat as a result of which their bones are also big and strong.
Hence patients of category - I require an average of 1200 mg Calcium and 400 to 600 units ' vitamin - D ' everyday.
Dose of osteoporosis is necessary for patients of category -1 like common patients.
According to an interesting research if baby is given ' vitamin - D ' then danger of occurrence of category - 1 diabetes reduces.
There is more chance of occurrence of infection to patients of diabetes.
Various deformities and mortality rate can increase in patients due to infection.
There can be various reasons for its basis.
Immunity reducing , nerves of body or nervous system getting affected negatively , glucose level increasing in skin.
The level of amount of glucose in skin exceeding 150 , danger of bone infection increases.
Hence controlled amount of glucose is necessary in surgeries related to bones like joint transplant and treatments like joining or setting a broken bone.
If level of glycosylated hemoglobin increases by 2 % then by that danger of occurrence of abscess or ulcer increases by 1.6 % and danger of amputating a body part increases by 1.5 %.
Here it is reasonable to discuss the topic of diabetes and infection of feet because it is found so in most cases.
Due to the reason that sensory nerves get damaged , the feeling of hot and cold and injury in feet gets reduced and feet get continually damaged.
By damage of nerves that are manager of muscles there can be paralysis in feet , feet can become deformed or twisted.
By exertion of more pressure on less space chance of formation of ulcer increases.
In this manner by damage of nerves that control the temperature of skin , skin gets worse.
Because of blockage in the blood circulation of feet proper nutrition is unable to reach the feet and less white blood cells reach there.
Some white cells that reach get damaged because of diabetes since these cells save the body from infection.
Hence immunity becomes less.
Bone diseases occurring due to diabetes are in this manner :.
Weakening of bones , change coming in the walk , balance of body is not maintained by blockage of nerves occurrence of decrease in immunity , wound not filling up fast , getting an infection again and again from wound not healing and consequently from these diseases starting from handicap of patient even death can occur.
Because of diabetes infection of feet begins from the soles of feet.
In the beginning there is a redness in skin which remains even after pressing.
Skin gets tough.
There can be formation of ulcer by injury in foot that reaches the muscles and bones and pus can develop in foot , fingers can degenerate or darken.
You should cure patient immediately , surgery and amputation of foot are also combined in the treatment.
Infection of foot because of diabetes is a state of emergency.
It is necessary to do the amputation of foot in 80 % of the cases and treatment of patient on admitting in hospital in 20 % of the cases.
In Indian patients cause of 12 % cases of ulcer in feet is diabetes.
There is influence on joints because of diabetes.
Disease named ` Charcot joint ` can occur to 1 out of 600 patients of patients afflicted with diabetes.
The difference between infection and Charcot is this that in Charcot feet of patients are red , swollen , and twisted and patient does not have any pain in it and patient does not have fever.
A specific kind of test might be necessary to detect ` Charcot joint `.
Aid of diabetes control glucose control in blood , plaster of a specific shape , shoes and surgery can be taken in the treatment.
Because of diabetes bones become weak and so they can break soon.

Danger of infection during surgery can also increase because of diabetes.
It takes time for the bone to join in diabetes.
As a result of the bone breaking often deformity can occur in joints also.
Flexibility of joints ends by accumulation of glucose in joints , with this deformity can arise in skin of joints and bone fibers , consequently stiffness can occur in joints.
Skin of hands of patients of diabetes becomes thick , stiff like wax and dried up.
Fingers of hands stiffen and snap on bending.
This is also called ' trigger finger '.
The whole hand on some patients gets twisted then distortion comes in forefinger of some patients which is known by the name of ' dupuytren '.
Because of these difficulties patients can not even perform the action of namaskar properly.
Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in nerves and hands and surgery is taken for treatment.
Normally shoulders of both arms get jammed else stiffness occurs in them because of which patients can not even comb their hair.
Patients become unsuccessful in rotating their arms behind their waist or above.
It takes a long time for such patients to recover.
Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in joints , telescope or general surgery is taken for treatment.
Nerves get deformed due to diabetes.
Blockage occurs in blood circulation in vessels by excess of glucose in blood and other defects can also arise in vessels because of which most patients lose balance related control of sense and body.
Many problems like shock in hands and feet , feeling a burning sensation , in hands and feet going numb , occurrence of paralysis and fingers getting distorted can originate.
Defect can also arise in the muscles of feet and patient is unable to walk properly.
Occurrence of problem like compression of nerve by thickening and stiffening of skin near and inside joints and by blood circulation not occurring normally is a common symptom.
Mostly nerves of wrists can compress , by compression of medial nerve of wrist ' carpal tunnel syndrome ' occurs.
In this pain , shock and numbness which usually increases at night time occur in thumb and with it in two and a half fingers.
This difficulty can also happen to patients of diabetes by working on the computer in a wrong position or working much , holding the newspaper , etc..
This problem occurs more in patients of diabetes in those doing work related to much bending and rotating of wrist.
The treatment of every problem in diabetes starts with control of glucose in blood through medicines.
Hence control on amount of glucose is vital to prevent adverse effects on nerves because of diabetes.
In addition to this treatment is done by pain killers , vitamins , pancreas transplant.
Main cause of disease of kidneys is a diabetes generated disease.

Disease of kidneys occurring due to diabetes is called nephropathy.
This disease is detected in diabetes patients when protein products in urine are found to be 500 mg on running a urine test.
In comparison to white people the chance of occurrence of diabetes generated kidney disease in Asian Indians is 40 times more.
On initial level kidney disease in diabetes patients is detected via a special test when the level of their albumin is found abnormal 30 mg  per day.
The danger of kidney and heart disease to such patients is more.
This disease can be stopped via initial diagnosis and proper treatment of disease.
The following are the causes of diabetes generated kidney disease.
Having disease of diabetes for a long time.
Not having a proper control on blood glucose.
High blood pressure , heredity , race , smoking etc.can also be causes of diabetes generated kidney disease.
Diabetes generated kidney disease occurs because of protein urea on increase in amount of protein in urine and glomerular filtration rate G.F.R.
The main cause of diabetes generated kidney disease is uncontrolled level of blood glucose in body.
However imbalance of blood glucose in body is harmful for cells and other body parts which can become a cause of various kinds of ailments.
Hence it is possible to prevent diabetes generated kidney disease to quite an extent keeping level of blood glucose controlled in diabetes patients and diagnosing the disease on the preliminary level and detecting microalbumin urea in the urine.
Urine of 24 hours is tested to detect microalbumin urea.
This is the most reliable test for detecting microalbumin urea.

It is also possible to do this test by a recent sample of urine.
Preliminary prevention is having control on blood glucose.
The normal level of HbA1C blood glucose is Up to 7 %.
Chances of other complications arising because of diabetes remain less till this level but on HbA1c being more than 7 % all relative efforts should be made to control blood glucose.

Therefore diabetes patient can prevent other disease occurring from this disease by keeping proper control on blood glucose.
Diabetes patients should keep blood pressure less than 125  75.
Reducing blood pressure from 85 to 81 means reducing diabetes generated kidney disease by 55 %.
It remains quite useful to give medicines like Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for keeping level of blood pressure maintained normal.

Take appropriate therapy for anemia , lipid ailment and treat it taking antibiotic medicines or injections of insulin on much increase in amount of glucose.
Conclusively you can say that diabetes generated kidney disease is the main cause of kidney failure.
Hence diabetes patients should keep doing their regular check-up so that preliminary diagnosis of the diabetes generated kidney disease is possible and through relative treatment the disease is stopped from advancing.
In both there is adverse effect on processes of various body parts like metabolism nervous system by defect in insulin and increase in glucose level and immunity system and skin also gets affected by it.
In most of the diabetes afflicted patients changes related to skin are seen.
However in most of the cases causes of changes that occur in skin remain unknown.
Because of occurrence of defect in vessels , nerves or because of decrease in immunity in body due to excess of glucose and imbalanced level of insulin skin related disease occur in diabetes patients.
Because of diabetes such substances get accumulated below skin and inside skin by which skin becomes thick and tough.
Normally such a situation arises at that time when residual substances do not get out of skin through sweat.
Because of diabetes activities of joints become limited.
In some patients due to accumulation of proteins in the fingers of hands and feet there is inconvenience in trying to move them and their efficiency is affected badly.
Various types of wounds and injuries occur in feet and legs on increase in level of glucose in blood or not consuming the medicines properly.
Because of these wounds and injuries a specific kind of fluid gets stored in the arteries.
In some cases blood circulation can lessen or stop in the skin of body.
Because of diabetes deep wounds that are non-healing occur.
Efficiency of nervous system gets adversely affected by excess of glucose in arteries that convey blood to the nervous system.
As a result of which that organ or part of body goes numb and injury in numbed parts can not be detected and the danger of occurrence of infection in the wound is retained.
Excess of glucose makes the immune system of the body also atrophic.
By which microbes  germs admitted in the body do not terminate because of which body becomes prey to any kind of infection soon.

Amount of fat in body increases due to diabetes.
Amount of glucose increases because of a specific enzyme by which efficiency of body reduces or ends.
Red and yellow rashes develop on skin.
Though these rashes can be in any part of the body but generally they are more near the joints.
Rashes named ' jennthomas ' develop by amount of cholesterol or triglycerides increasing in blood.

In most families of Indian society the popular methods of family planning are adopted less even today.
Even if adopted the responsibility comes around and falls on the woman 's head only.

As far as the question of contraceptives related to women is concerned they also have their advantages and disadvantages.
కాపర్-టీ తో మహిళలకి జననంగాలలో ఇన్‍ఫెక్షన్ అవటం సందేహంగా ఉండిపోతుంది.
They advise those women who do not have any child or have only one child and want another child in future to avoid it.
ఈవిధమైన మాత్రలు తీసుకోవటం కూడా తమకి తంటాలు ఉన్నాయి.

They also have side - effects which can effect adversely on the bodies of women.
Perhaps this is the reason that despite running family planning programs on the both the levels of government as well as non - government even today women become unwanted mothers in a large number.
According to a report of national health survey even today 78 % of conceptions in India are unplanned.

In the decade of seventies by stressing on vasectomy extreme strictness was done in the achievement of goals.
As a result opposition was produced among masses towards family planning program.
During the seventh plan year 1985 - 90 in place of the family planning program the program was given the identity of family welfare.
In this special emphasis was given on the health related needs of women of reproductive age and children of less than five years.
In 1985 - 86 pervasive vaccination was started.
In pervasive vaccination the aim was fixed to bring down the death rate and sickness of young children from such diseases whose prevention is possible through vaccines.
Thereafter by looking at the benefits of this program in the decade of nineties child safety and safe motherhood C.S.S.M.was prepared and implemented from 1992 - 93.
In the present times all the family welfare services continuing from before were kept implemented.
In it reproductive health , youth health , sex generated disease , infection of reproductive system and AIDS were included.
It was given the name of reproduction and child health.
Reproduction and child health program was implemented in the region.
In the place of goal oriented method from the year 1997 community needs are ascertained on the basis of assessment policy.
The work plan of health workers only would be the base of all the plans.
After unifying the plans created on the sub centres it would be given the form of district work plan.
The district work plans together would take the form of state work plan.
In order to supply the goods to state the national plan would be based on the state work plan.
The partner plan is the form of proposal.
The principle essay of the ninth plan published by the planning commission has been written.
It is written in it that the government investment during the eighth plan for family welfare is reducing.
The extra expenditure of the eighth plan has also been less than that of the seventh plan.
This situation looks even more unsatisfactory.
At every level there is a need of upliftment of health care system.
The health care program should be made to reach to more and more people.
So that at the end the national goal may be achieved.
However because of the economic development , spread of education  literacy and due to the rights given to the citizens there has been a constant improvement in the program in the past years.
In the states with less execution many problems are present in relation to weak implementation , because of the women not receiving enough rights and education  literacy.
Under the reproduction and health program the solution to these problems would be achieved through the following strategy.
Giving importance to community participation in planning and services.
Adopting consumer centric arrangement in services.
Arrangement of high standard services and better training.
Removal of contraceptive goal and encouragement.
Making the services gender sensitive.
Adoption of multidimensional methods in the implementation and monitoring of services.
Under the child safety and safe motherhood C.M.M.S.plan in the unification process of the programs one more step was taken in 1994.
In the population and development conference in the country of Egypt the proposal for the unification of reproduction and child health R.C.H.programs were tabled.
In the reproduction and child health policy it has been emphasized on this thing that people should have the power to control reproductive force.
Women may be able to get safe conception.
Couple should be able to keep sexual relation without the fear of conception or disease.
Accordingly the mission of the ninth plan was kept that all the related programs of eighth plan would be unified.
The goal of reproduction and child health R.C.H.conceptualization is that according to the requirement decided by them high standard reproduction and child health.
Reproductive and child health R.C.H.is a unified program.
In this apart from other things the support of the organizations of Indian government and the support of external international organization of world bank and European commission etc are included.
It is the right of the citizens that good quality of reproductive and health services are available to them.
Therefore the mission of reproductive and child health program is to make available services of good quality.
So that for the citizens reliable reproduction and health can be ensured.
In this program the quality of the services have been clarified.
The quality of the services is that only which we want for our family.
The reproduction and child health program is completely centrally funded five year project.
There are some missions of the project - to bring reduction in the birth rate , infant mortality rate , child mortality rate and maternal mortality rate.
To bring reduction in the blindness caused by vitamin A.
Information for the prevention and treatment of infection produced by reproductive system and sex and protection against AIDS.

Three in the districts of A category and one R.T.I. S.T.I.clinic in districts with B category should be given the training of executive.
Under the reproduction and child health program the deputation of male and female doctors is being done after special training.
For the facility of tests on these units the facility of lab technician and essential instruments is being made available.
For holistic working of maternal and child welfare services sub - centres are being constructed.
Small scale and extensive work is being done at primary health centres and community health centres and district hospital in which delivery room , construction of operation theater , water fulfilment and electrical services are included.
There is proposal to give training to governmental and non - governmental doctors of Indian Medical Methodology working in rural areas by this their information regarding treatment and diseases related to maternal child welfare can be updated.
There is provision to give consciousness awakening training to the workers from the level of civil centres to rural level.
At present training is going on in all the civil centres.
For increasing the skill of the workers of various ranks skill enhancement training is being given.
The success of various programs is possible only after the advertisement of health education in masses.
This work is being executed in civil centres through the medium of district literacy committee.
In the rural areas sub - projects are being run.
in the sub - project the reproduction and child health program is being implemented in extensive form.
Urban R.C.H.Project is to be done in the six metropolitans of the country.
In order to make the workers , laboring  poor families living in the slums of Lucknow , Kanpur , Allahabad , Varanasi , Agra and Meerut benefit from health urban R.C.H.project is going to be started very soon by the Indian government.
Under this project reproduction related services would be provided to all the pregnant women , children up to five years and young girls through the medium of health post.
At every health post one doctor and two women workers would provide health services covering the population of 15000.
Cluster Border District Project is proposed in the bordering districts Banda , Chitrakoot , Mahoba , Hamirpur , Lalitpur and Jhansi of the state.
The border civil centres are the extremely backward civil centres of the state.
the health directives are very pitiable in these.
The goal of reducing maternal - rate , mortality rate and infant mortality rate have been tabled under the project.
Strengthening of sub - centres.
The distribution of medicines through the medium of sub - centres is included.
This project would be started soon enough with the help of the directive instructions of Indian government and UNICEF.
In the health services provided in rural regions services related to motherhood is provided.
Under these services the registration of pregnant women is got done.
Under these services three important tests are done in pregnancy.
Along with quick registration in pregnancy the use of iron , folic acid are ensured for protection against and treatment of anemia.
In order to save pregnant women from tetanus two vaccines are given at the interval of one month.
In the pregnancy the difficulties are identified and accounted.
If complications arise in delivery then immediately she should be sent to such unit where the diagnosis and treatment of complications is possible.
It is essential that the care of woman post delivery is taken by female health worker.
If post delivery complications arise then the woman should be referred to the proper health unit.
The meaning of anemia is deficiency of blood in the body.
Maximum women are affected by anemia in India.
In the blood of anaemic women there occurs the deficiency of iron and folic acid.
Because of which the quantity of hemoglobin gets reduced in their blood.
In normal male and female the quantity of hemoglobin in blood should be 14 and 12 respectively.
In pregnant women this level is generally found less.
The detection of anemia in pregnant women is generally through some of these symptoms.
Due to anemia there is feeling of weakness in normal days.
Pregnant woman suffering from malaria may suffer from anemia.
Because of anemia the symptoms of the paleness of face , dark circles under the eyes , paleness of nails , whitening of tongue , vomiting , swelling in feet , loss of appetite , headache etc are found.
Among the anaemic patients in India the number of pregnant women is the maximum.
In normal condition on the occurrence of anemia the immune capacity of the body reduces.
There is fatigue and weakness in this but during pregnancy on the occurrence of anemia this becomes harmful for the woman as well as her prospective child.
Anemia is the chief reason for maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate.
Due to anemia the weight of the new born baby may become very less than normal.
The new born baby may be born handicapped physically or mentally.
In anaemic women the milk is also not produced enough for the child.
The prevention and treatment of anemia -.
Anemia chiefly occurs due to the reason of deficiency of iron elements in the food materials.
The requirement of iron elements in pregnant women is more than normal.
Therefore such substances in which there is more iron like vegetables , salad , jaggery etc should definitely be included in food.
In pregnant women whose level of hemoglobin in blood is from 5 - 8 they have the requirement of treatment with caution in the care of the doctor itself.
One pill of iron should be given daily to pregnant woman for three months from three months after getting pregnant.
If the woman is pregnant before pregnancy then two pills of iron one morning one evening should be given to her for 100 days.
New born baby keeps getting iron in sufficient quantity from mother 's milk.
If any child is anaemic then normally it should be given one pill of iron daily after the age of 6 months.
One chief reason of anemia in women and children is the existence of worms in their body.
As for example if there is hookworm in someone 's stomach then the hookworm drinks 0.8 millilitre of blood from his body daily.
Therefore for protection against anemia it is very important to give this advice that women  children should wear footwear.
For protection against anemia the vegetable etc should be eaten after washing.
In order to be safe from anemia keep the nails short and clean so because of which any type of worm does not enter inside their body.
For protection against tetanus two vaccines should be put at the interval of one month.
First vaccine should be given immediately on the detection of pregnancy.
Due to this both mother and the child to be born would stay healthy.
Before delivery at least three tests are extremely important before delivery.
Pregnancy has been divided in three parts.
First three months trimester - from the first day of the last menstruation to 12 weeks.
Second three months trimester - 13 weeks to 28 weeks.
Third three months trimester - 29 weeks to 40 weeks.
Normal pregnancy is from the first day of the last menstruation for up to 280 days.
Female health worker and maid should take proper care of the new born child.
If there are complications in the new born baby then it should be referred to the right unit.
For the treatment of diarrhoea of children the solution of O.R.S.Should be used by the female health workers.
Imparting information of O.R.S.to the family is important.
For the treatment of pneumonia in children the use of cotrimoxazol should be done.
It is important for every health worker to have information about nutrition.
Health workers should certainly make available information related to the nutrition to each family.
It is extremely important for the body to get protein , iron , folic acid , vitamin ' A ' and iodine in proper quantity.
In pregnancy the growth of foetus is possible only when the pregnant woman is healthy and properly fed.
Therefore during pregnancy the pregnant woman has the requirement of one and half times more food and rest.
In food protein , milk , fish , eggs , and cereals , various types of pulses , vegetables , peanuts and gram etc should be taken in sufficient quantity.
In women especially the pregnant women the use of iron and folic acid should be started quickly.
The pregnant women are made to use hundred pills of iron and folic acid for safety and two hundred pills for the sake of treatment.
There will not be complete benefit on the use of less pills by pregnant woman.
Vitamin A solution is extremely beneficial for children.
Five doses of vitamin A should be given at the interval of 6 months.
Due to this the child stays free from various diseases.
Because of the use of vitamin A solution on the occurrence of any disease even the intensity of the disease will not increase.
Vitamin A also protects from blindness.
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A the disease of night blindness occurs.
This disease night blindness changes into blindness later on.
Iodine is an extremely nutritive substance for body.
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A diseases like abortion , deafness in children , dumbness , mental retardation , physical handicappedness and goitre may occur.
In order to prevent these diseases it is essential that the use of iodine rich salts should be done in each family.
For family limitation various contraceptives are available at sub - centres.
In order to keep proper gap between two children I.U.D.copper T is implanted by female health workers.
Pills which can be eaten and nirodh are also distributed.
To couples having two or more children the advice of male or female tubectomy is given.
In men the facility of vasectomy is available without incision and stitches for free.
The detection of patients of diarrhoea , cholera , whooping cough , diphtheria , tetanus , polio , measles , tuberculosis , leprosy and malaria should be done.
The detection of patients of reproductive system infection , sex produced diseases and AIDS should be done and advice regarding protection and treatment should be given.
To keep record of birth and death in the region and informing village panchayat officer.
Because of cold affecting the child cold , fever , and cough happens.
If the treatment is not done quickly then pneumonia happens to the child.
On the occurrence of pneumonia if proper treatment is not done then the death of child may even occur.
According to the figures available in the hospital in the ward of children the reason of 13 percent of total infant mortality is pneumonia.
Therefore information of the status of pneumonia , identification of danger , treatment and where to refer the complicated cases is very important.
In the initial stage domestic treatment and in the situation of seriousness by referring to the right place many children can be saved.
many times due to the lack of proper information also the deaths of children occur.
The identification of pneumonia and management -.
When the child has cold and cough both then pneumonia may occur to him.
the identification of pneumonia happens due to rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs.
With cough rapid breathing rate and movement of ribs.
Together with above symptoms fever , fatigued child , difficulty in breathing.
The methods of management may be the following -.
Safe and proper medicine is available.
The treatment may take place at home by the mother.
The child has the need of treatment with cotrimoxazole.
There is need to refer the child.
While counting the rate of breathing special things should be kept in mind.
At the time of the counting of breathing rate the child must be relaxing or sleeping.
The child should be crying or in difficulty.
For this choose any peaceful place in the clinic.
For counting the rate of breathing the lower portion of the chest or back should be completely uncovered.
By using the seconds needle in your watch count the breathing rate in one minute.
How to identify fast breathing rate ? 
In child of less than two months of age the rate of breathing being 60 per minute or more.
In child from 2 to 15 months 50 per minute or more.
In the age of 1 to 5 years of age in the condition of pneumonia 40 per minute or more.
If the breathing rate is more than the above mentioned levels then count again and finalize your diagnosis.
While seeing the movement of ribs keep in mind special things.
The meaning of the movement of ribs is that the movement of the lower part of the chest certainly towards inside with breathing.
Only the soft tissue between the ribs or the upper part of the collar bone goes inside with the breathing of the child.
This will not be called the movement of the ribs.
The movement of the ribs have been defined in the form of sub costal suction or pull.
The movement of ribs in small children is normal thing.
The sight if ribs very clearly very deep and easy to see may be the sign of pneumonia.
If you are doubtful about the ribs of the child then change the position of the child and check again.
If the body of the child is bent from waist then the decision of the speed of the lower part of the chest is doubtful.
Change the position of the child in such manner that he keeps lying straight in the lap of the mother.
Despite this if the movement of the ribs is not seen clearly then it should be believed that the ribs are not moving.
the movement of the ribs is important only when it moves continuously and is seen clearly.
If this is seen only in the unhappy state of the child or while it is taking nutrition and not in the state of rest then believe that there is no rib movement.
Symptoms of extremely serious pneumonia -.
The child feeling more sleepy and difficulty in waking up.
The noise of throat clearing even when silent.
Production of sound in the breathing of the child or occurrence of fits.
Extreme malnutrition to the child.
Fever or feeling of cold on touching in very small child.
According to the rate of breathing treatment may be done at home or at health center.
In case of serious pneumonia admit the patient in the hospital.
In extreme pneumonia certainly admit the child in such a hospital or health center where the facility of oxygen is available.
Children less than two months of age in whom there is rapid breathing rate they should be treated for serious pneumonia.
Those children in whom there are symptoms of pneumonia and are malnourished they should be taken to the hospital immediately.
In order to escape from the danger of pneumonia inform the mother.
Keep the new born baby warm.
Feed only mother 's milk to the child up to six months.
To children older than six months give other substances apart from milk.
Definitely get the D.P.T.and measles vaccination at the right time.
Before touching , feeding milk and feeding food to children especially new born babies certainly wash the hands.
Control the fever with the paracetamol tablet.
Certainly give the right dose of antibiotic to children suffering from pneumonia.
Counsel the mother repeatedly , till the time it is not sure that the mother has understood this matter that it is essential to give special attention to children suffering from pneumonia.
If in the feeding of the child the nose is obstructing then for its cleaning reduction of sticky substance use salty water.
Give more liquid to the child to drink.
Remove the irritation of the throat and cure the cough through safe treatment.
For getting rid of cough lemon , honey , ginger , basil , hot water etc domestic treatment should be encouraged.
Nutritive food and clean water , hygiene and vaccination these are the three most important body protectors.
Protecting your child from several diseases these keep your child healthy.
There is deep relation between food and health.
With balanced diet balanced health is made.
before independence the situation of drought and hunger used to generally arise in our country.
Today due to the reason of mentionable achievements in the field of agriculture in the past decades the production of cereals , vegetables and fruits has increased many times.
But unfortunately in the country the rate of population increase has advanced faster than the rate of increase of cereals.
The growth of population has happened more in the section of poor people only.
Due to this some very well off people became unhealthy because of over nutrition.
That problem of malnutrition is looming even today in front of the maximum poor population.
Poverty and lack of purchasing power are chief reasons for malnutrition of a large section of population of our country.
There are some ill effects of malnutrition.
There is a deep relation between malnutrition and unhealthiest.
Because of lack of purchasing power of maximum population of India they are not able to take nutritious food.
They stay victims of under nutrition.
In such situation they also have to do hard physical labor for their livelihood.
Due to under nutrition the energy balance negative energy balance of their body reduces.
As a result their capacity to work reduces.
Due to undernourishment the disease - immune capacity of the body also decreases.
Due to this unhealthiest increases.
Malnutrition has very bad effect on reproduction and child health.
Therefore for reproduction and child health the knowledge of facts related to nutrition is essential.
The estimation of the nutrition status of any person is helpful in keeping him healthy.
Generally this is measured by the condition of the weight of the person , age , height , hemoglobin in blood and other elements.
Malnutrition only is the health problem - reason is not poverty but lack of information.
For keeping the child healthy there is need to have enough information to the mother and the family members.
Large number of children India are left malnourished.
While the things of their need is available in the nature itself.
RD_PUNC V_VAUX RP_NEG N_NN PSP N_NN JJ PSP PSP PR_PRP 
The need is of the information that what should be the right diet to be given to the children by which the children may stay healthy.
the girls should also be given food equal to that of boys.
Abstain from food like alcohol , tobacco , excess oil rich food , excess chilli and spices , excess sugar and salt and excess tea , coffee.
the foundation of the health of the child starts from the pregnancy itself.
The kind of food which the pregnant woman gets the growth of the child also takes place according to it.
Thus , from pregnancy itself it is important for the child to get nutritional food.
Here the meaning of nutritive is not expensive food but food rich with vitamin , protein , and iron substances.
In what situation the food of the child may be cheap and nutritive ? 
In pregnancy food should be consumed in the right quantity and nutritive.
In food eat such things in which iron elements , vitamin A and iodine are in rich quantity.
There is the need of vitamin A to the pregnant woman.
For eye sight there is the need of vitamin A to every woman.
Because of the deficiency of vitamin A night blindness may occur in pregnant woman and mother who has already fed milk who has fed milk to child.
If there would be deficiency of vitamin A in mother then this deficiency would be there in the child as well.
Due to this even the eye sight of the child may also go.
Due to the deficiency of vitamin A there is high risk of contracting other infections as well.
There should not be the deficiency of vitamin A by eating green leafy vegetables like lettuce , pot herb , mustard , cabbage , radish , gram lentil.
The fruits and vegetables of yellow color like mango , papaya , carrot and gourd are beneficial in removing the deficiency of vitamin A.
These things are easily available in rural districts.
Apart from this you can also take curd , cheese , eggs , liver in the food.
By giving the child nutritional substance along with breast feeding we make the child healthy and capable of fighting with the infections.
After one year if the upper arm of the child is less than 13 c.m.then he is malnourished.
If it is less than 12 c.m.then he is malnourished in the extreme form.
There is the requirement of iodine to pregnant women.
Due to the deficiency of iodine apart from the disease of goitre many other harmful conditions may arise.
Due to the deficiency of iodine the child may have mental retardation.
The child may be miscarried or may be born dead.
the child may be deaf or dumb.
There could be stiffness like paralysis in the bone of his knee.
Some quantity of iodine is obtained by us from water and vegetables.
Due to the reason of environmental pollution we do not get the proper quantity of iodine.
Always keep the iodine salt in closed vessel , not in uncovered vessel.
Because of coming getting air in uncovered vessel dampness comes in the salt.
Because of this the iodine mixed in salt does not stay in the proportion to the body.
What should be the proper type of food for child ? 
In the life and growth of the child his weight at the time of birth plays a very important role.
In Indian conditions the weight of the child at the time of birth should normally be 2.7 k.g.
The weight of one third of children at the time of birth is found to be less than 2.5.k.g.
In infant mortality rate the number of children less than 2 k.g.Is found to be maximum.
Children of less weight are born to mothers suffering from anemia.
The quantity of hemoglobin of mother at the time of birth is less than 8 then the weight of the child at the time of birth may be very less.
For such women there is need of A.N.C.
The child having less weight at the time of birth depends on the nutritional condition of the mother.
The nutritional condition of the mother depends on the financial condition of the mother.
The child having less weight at the time of birth are generally related to poor families.
On not taking excess protein the face stay swelled , decolouring of hair and skin , thinning of upper arm , flakes on the skin and hands and feet stay swelled.
Right from the time of birth it is important to give special attention to food for good health of the child.
In order to make the child disease free the child must get the first milk of the mother.
the child should not be given tonic , honey etc.
certainly make the child drink mother 's milk.
the milk of mother protects the child from diseases.
In the milk of mother there is vitamin A and all nutritive elements.
In the mother 's milk there are those nutritive elements which are not found in any milk.
Mother 's milk is food and medicine for the child.
Mother 's milk is beneficial to the child economically as well.
In sickness the child gets help from mother 's milk in becoming alright.
While feeding the child special attention should be given to the child for cleanliness.
The child should be fed till the time he does not start asking for food on his own.
Approximately 33 percent children are of less weight at the time of birth less than 2.5 kilogram.
But within 6 months this rate remains 15 percent.
Such happens because in all the communities there has been validity of feeding up to six months of birth.
The child keeps getting nutritive substance from the milk of the mother.
The weight of children of the age group of 6 - 11 months and 12 - 23 months gets reduced under weight again.
Its first reason is that starting to give other food materials apart from mother 's milk long before six months.
Or else not starting to give any other food materials apart from mother 's milk even after six months.
its second reason is , due to the reason of infection increase in the rate of disease morbidity rate.
In order to escape from both these problems it is essential that the family members should be given the information about nutrition education.
Even after six months other food materials should be given together with mother 's milk.
Generally nutritive food materials should be given 4 - 5 times in a day in balanced quantity.
For protection against diseases cleanliness especially the purity of the drinking water should be paid attention to.
the children of 2 - 5 years generally start eating.
Due to this improvement comes also in children born with less weight.
The information of availability of nutritive substances at low price should be given to the families of children of this age group.
This information is imparted under various programs like woman and child development department and family welfare programs.
The children from 5 to 14 years of age generally come in the group of school going children.
They are distributed medical tests and nutritive diet under the mid - day meal program and school health program.
the children who do not go to school stay devoid of this.
In the ninth five year plan the registration of all the children in the school , continuation of the mid - day program and test of the weight of children and disease should be arranged.
In youth the physical and mental growth occur very fast.
In youth there is requirement of various nutritive elements.
Sufficient attention is not given on the nutrition of people of this age group.
Due to this here maximum become victim of under nutrition.
The wealthy section become victim of obesity.
Due to marriage or conception in young age generally anemia or reduced hemoglobin are found.
It ill effect is seen both on the mother and the prospective child.
To solve these problems information is imparted trough the media of the programs like health education , nutrition education and I.C.D.S.Programme and R.C.H.program.
Nutritive food is the mantra for good health.
the strength to fight against disease is obtained from food.
The child of the body also needs this strength.
For this the most important are vitamin A and iron elements.
At least three to four times in a week the child should be given vitamin A rich food.
Every second day half bowl of lentils should be fed.
Due to this there would not be any deficiency of vitamin A.
Deep impact falls on the eyes due to the deficiency of vitamin A.
To keep a check on growth the weight of the children less than six years is also taken in anganbari.
Apart from this for the growth of children information regarding right upbringing , information of vaccination and knowledge of health is also imparted.
Apart from this here proper education is also given for the mental growth of children.
This way it has become clear that for pregnant woman and child there is no need of any such food which is very expensive.
In rural districts also the facility of anganbari is available.
the girls are also in need of that much of food as the boys.
generally it has been seen that in comparison to boys less attention is paid in the upbringing of girls.
It is said that later on boys have to earn.
The boys will only fulfil the major responsibilities of the house.
While apart from the responsibilities of the house the girls have to give birth to children later on.
If the girls are weak then post marriage their children will also be weak.
If the vicious cycle of early marriage and less birth duration is maintained then the prospective children would be weak.
Therefore how much important nutritious food is for boys that much it is also for girls.
Vitamin A has high importance for child.
New born baby gets vitamin A from mother 's milk.
On not getting mother 's milk night blindness may occur in children.
With the vaccination of measles the dose of vitamin A is given.
The virus of measles and chicken pox affect the stock of vitamin A of the body.
Generally the child does not die of measles or chicken pox but due to infections happening after that like pneumonia , dysentery , brain fever etc.
If pregnant women and their family members are given these informations then definitely mother and child may be protected from becoming the victims of malnutrition.
For protecting the child from malnutrition the requirement is not of more money but of right knowledge.
There are many forms of malnutrition.
By taking excess carbohydrate and not taking protein substance kwashiorkor.
Marasmus on not getting more food.deficiency of everything protein , carbohydrate and fat marasmus.
Those children who do not drink milk or does not consume sunlight vitamin - D various types of diseases may surround them like rickets.
occurrence of many diseases related to skin from malnutrition.
Swelling and bleeding in gums due to malnutrition.
In the past decades in India also many changes have come in the life style of people.
Due to the facilities at present reduction has come in the physical labor of man.
Because of this reason the problem of obesity has come up.
Because of excess food the quantity of many substances start reaching in the blood of man more than normal.
Due to this diseases like heart disease , diabetes etc start occurring.
In the society for this section also health education and nutrition education is to be provided.
Children like chicks should always keep eating something or the other.
At least three times in a day something or the other should be given to the children to eat.
In between meals snacks should be given.
Children should be given energy rich nutritive substance.
Breast feeding is complete food.
Till the time it is possible it should be fed.
Extra nutritive substance should be given to malnourished children.
For easy digestion the food materials should be cooked properly.
For making the food material energy rich little bit of oil fat should be added.
If you have to keep your child healthy then purchase nutritive substance , fruits , milk , eggs etc.
Do not buy tea , coffee , cool drink.
Under the reproduction and child health program the behavioural aspect and the prevention of diseases related to S.T.D. R.T.I. A.I.D.S.have been included.
Many infections in reproductive system infection R.T.I.are produced by bacteria , virus and protozoa.
This infection occurs in upper and lower part of the reproductive system of male and female body.
S.T.D.and H.I.V.A.I.D.S., occur due to R.T.I.
Every R.T.I.is not a sex produced disease.
There are some general reasons also for reproductive system infection.
the infections occurring due to the overgrowth of organs found generally in the reproductive system are called endogenous infection.
S.T.D.is the collection of communicable diseases.
This is spread by the unsafe sexual relations.
Such infections which occur due to insufficient medical processes like unsafe abortion , unsafe delivery or implant of I.U.D.by unhygienic method.
These are called iatrogenic infections.
H.I.V. A.I.D.S.is found in developed and developing countries.
The havoc of AIDS is justified.
the infection of R.T.I. S.T.I.is found more in developing countries.
Its reason are biomedical , behavioural and social.
Maximum of these are in social transition period.
With increase of youth population urbanisation is progressing with even less restrictions.
Because of the discharge of foul smelling liquid from the vagina or in the condition of occurrence of itching , pain or inflammation R.T.I.or S.T.D.may occur.

What is colostrums ? 
Why is it essential to feed colostrums ? 
How should the baby be fed the milk so that the lactation can be fast ? 
The first milk of mother is thick , yellow and sticky substance , which is called colostrums or first milk.
It is essential to give colostrums to the child.
Immediately after the birth within 1 hour certainly feed it your milk.
This thick and yellow milk is the elixir for the child.
The natural substances present in it save it from contracting dysentery , cold , cough etc diseases.
In this the vitamin A substance beneficial for the child is present in huge quantity.
It helps in the expulsion of the black faeces of the child.
Never understand this that the first secreted milk is bad or indigestible.
This is a wrong thought , on the contrary the substances which are quick to digest are found in more quantity which is suitable for the new born baby.
After delivery it comes out for two three days with the milk of the mother.
Many times the child is not able to suck the breast properly , but keep trying , it will very quickly.
Whether milk comes out or not let the baby suck both the breasts certainly for at least half an hour one after the other , do such many times , the mother will start lactating the very first day.
During the breast feeding the full part of areola the dark portion around the nipple should be inside the mouth of the child.
When the child will suck the dark part then the mother 's milk will be secreted fast and will be produced more.
Giving tonic , making honey lick , giving the solution of sugar and water to the new born baby are old customs and traditions.

The microbes which cause dysentery harm the intestines of the body.
The power of the intestines to digest and absorb the food gets lost or lessened.

This fulfils the loss of water , minerals and other nutritive elements produced in the body due to dysentery.
Generally on the onset of dysentery medicines should not be given.
In abnormal situation on the advice of the doctor medicines may be administered.
According to the World Health Organisation the chief elements of life saving solution are - glucose anhydrous 20 gram , sodium chloride that is , common salt 3.5 gram , sodium citrate 2.9 gram , potassium chloride 1.5 gram.

It was also seen that even in the midst of noisy environment these students were able to do the work with more concentration.
Because of all this much improvement was seen in the reading , spelling and maths.
Mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern lifestyle may also become the cause of the spread of disease.
Here in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of ' Washi ' situated MGM hospital this fact has come up.
In the study the phones of more than 82 percent of the workers of the hospital have been found to be the carriers of the microbes and spores of contagious diseases.
By this there is chance of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , acne - blisters , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases.
In this study done by the Indian Medical Research Council 120 mobile phones of the workers were tested.
The researcher Dr.Nikhil Tambe final year M.B.B.S.student of MGM hospital found that bacteria and spores were found on 99 phones out of them.
This bacteria together with making the disease of the patient serious also become the cause of the delay of the cure.
Tambe said that the presence of the maximum number of bacteria were found in the phones of the technicians.
After this the mobile phones of ward boy , nurse and then doctors were found infected serially.
Dr.Chitra Pai , chief of the microbiology department of the hospital said that on the mobile phones maximum 54.6 percent ' staphylococcus accrues ' bacteria were found.
This microbe can become the cause of skin disease.
Apart from this in mobile phones microbes like E - Coli and pseudomonas were also found.
Due to the infection of E - Coli and pseudomonas microbes maximum ill effect is seen on the health.
Two years back in a study done in Coiambatore the presence of 96.2 percent microbes was found on the phones of hospital workers.
First let me tell you as to what are antioxidants ? 
As our age passes some or the other type of loss occurs in our body.
We generally see that some people appear old before age while some appear comparitively young even at the age of 80 years.
The answer to this is with modern medical science and this answer is the deficiency of antioxidant in our food.
All around us there is pollution , tensile environment and many among us smoke cigarette actively.
All this speed up the process of destruction in body after uniting.
Even the diseases of the heart to great extent can be due to this destructive process.
Just like the rust on the iron exposed in air which occurs due to oxidation the cause of the destruction in the body is also oxygen and tissues  the chemical reaction of the enzymes.
The accumulated fat in the arteries of the heart L.D.L.Cholesterol gets oxidised before getting accumulated.
Antioxidants are micronutrient substances which stop the destruction occurring in the tissues and organs of the body.
Therefore these have immense capacity to keep the disease of the heart at bay and for its treatment reversal.
Along with antioxidants there are other substances as well which are essential to make the food complete which help our heart and other organs and make our body healthy and increase the immune capacity of our body.
This collection of the information of heart , throw light on these food making it complete.
This is the wonder food of future antioxidants.
In continuous fast life generally man is left devoid of nutrition or else stays dependent on diet consisting of less nutrition.
In this relation can we think something for ourselves or our family instead.
This is that portion of knowledge related to nutrition which has been specially created for us.
Every capsule of this knowledge give us information about vitamins and minerals , which are important for our health.
What are free radicals ? 
In what way do these harm human body ? 
In what way Vitamin E and other antioxidant nutritive substances protect the body from the destruction of free radicals.
We will try to give answers to these questions and will tell that fruits and vegetables rich in 5 - 8 types of antioxidants may be beneficial for your health.
For the knowledge of this thing that how free radicals and antioxidants react with each other , little bit of knowledge is essential in the subject of tissues and molecules.
Physiology , for the revision of chemistry brief chapters have been given here.
Human body is made up of various types tissues and tissues are made up of various types of molecules.
In molecules there may be one or more atoms which remain tied due to chemical bond.
In atom there are nucleus , neutron , proton and electron.
Electrons participate in chemical reactions and keep the atom tied in the form of molecule.
Electron keeps the atom surrounded in one or many shells.
Certainly oxygen element is extremely important for life , but in some conditions it is even harmful for human body.
Due to the reactivity of oxygen many harmful compounds are formed.
These are called the compounds of reactive oxygen species.
Reactive oxygen compound give oxygen to other substances according to their own nature.
Many out of these reactive species are free radicals and consist of one or more extra electron.
This way because of the lack of similar compounds it is the cause of instability and extreme reactivity.
Oxygen atom is the cause of the reason of ageing , heart disease , stiffening of the artery , the reason of loss of immune capacity , damage of free radicals.
Due to these losses the conditions of stiffness of the arteries , diabetes , cataract and premature agreeing arise.
The contribution of antioxidant is extremely effective in the prevention of cancer , heart disease , Alzheimer 's disease , rheumatism and cataract.
Together with different oxidants these work in different cellular compartments.
The system of enzyme is an important aspect of immunity capacity , glutathione peroxidise , superoxide dismutase and catalase etc which reduce the accumulation of some harmful oxidants in the tissues.
Some essential minerals are - selenium , copper , manganese and zinc etc are essential for the production of the activity of the live enzymes.
Another security line of the immune capacity of the body towards the harm of the free radicals is the presence of antioxidants.
Antioxidants is a molecule which is at least so stable that they can give one electron to free radicals and make them inert so that their capacity to harm is lessened.
Some antioxidants of this type are antioxidants , glutatione ubiquinol and uric acid which are produced during the normal metabolism of the body.
Though till now around 9000 antioxidants have been detected.
The most popular antioxidants are Vitamin E , Vitamin C and carotenoids.
Tissues of oxygen free radicals oxygen free radicals are produced during digestion.
These poisonous molecules of tissues are produced in the body due to the cause of the light of the sun , x - ray radiation , food , tobacco or the smoke of car and other pollutants of the atmosphere.
In fact these free radicals harm DNA that is the ones providing hereditary characteristics.
Microbes convert chemical compounds and at times completely destroy the tissues.
With the help of antioxidants the compensation of this damage can be done.
In which way can the antioxidants protect from the harm occurring due to the frss radicals ? 
The ones providing immunity are the antioxidants substances.
As it is clear from the name antioxidants are those substances which stop the destruction occurring in the body and normalise the oxidation process occurring in the tissues of the organisms.
These nutritive substance vitamin and mineral are enzymes the supportive protein in the chemical reactions situated in the body.
It is believed that these protect from the ill effects of the free radicals.
By donating their personal electron the antioxidants depress the process of stealing electron by the free radicals.
After shunning the electron also they do not become free radical because in themselves they have stability.
Antioxidants stop the process of oxidation , by deactivating the free radicals.
In doing such the oxidation of them takes place.
Therefore the sources of antioxidants have to be maintained uninterrupted.
Though you take multivitamin regularly , consume extra vitamin C , many types of fruits , vegetables , then also it is not essential that you are getting sufficient antioxidant.
With respect to these nutritive substances fighting cancer , health enhancer specialists have given opinion.
here such substances are being named which should be taken in daily breakfast.
Among the antioxidants given daily there are vitamin C , vitamin E and selenium.
Vitamin E is found in two types tocopherol and trocotreinol.
If you are taking any vitamin E then it would be tocopherol because at present tocopherol is under research.
What does tocopherol do ? 
Tocopherol protects from heart disease , stroke , Alzheimer 's disease and cancer.
The immune capacity also increases with tocopherol.
Trocotreinol fights against heart disease , breast cancer , it also protects the skin from ultraviolet radiations.
Where is tocopherol found ? 
In less quantity tocopherol is found in almonds and vegetable oils.
Trocotreinol is found in the husk of rice.
For therapeutic dose the need for other complementary substances arises.
The dose of natural Vitamin E has been suggested in the form of 400 to 800 I.U.Of mixed tocopherol.
What does selenium do ? 
Selenium protects from cancer , heart disease , cataract , muscular degeneration and is supportive in the function of other antioxidant.
Where is selenium found ? 
Selenium is found in brazil nut , cereal , vegetables and its quantity various according to the regional soil.
In the suggested dose 100 to 200 mcg of selenium with food or even without food daily.
Do not take selenium in large quantity otherwise poisoning may occur.
Start taking antioxidants after the age of forty years.
If before the age of 40 years you have to take many pills then you should not take coenzyme Q - 10 alpha lpoic acid.
Coenzyme Q - 10 fights against cancer and heart disease.
Coenzyme Q - 10 makes the gums strong , protects nerves , is helpful in energy production.
Where is coenzyme Q - 10 is found ? 
Coenzyme Q - 10 is present in each tissue of body , specially in heart.
Coenzyme Q - 10 is also found in almonds and oils but for medicinal dose extra quantity may be needed to be consumed.
In the suggested dose with daily food 30 mg of coenzyme Q - 10 specially , is important for heart patients.
What does alpha lipoic acid does ? 
Alpha lipoic acid protects from the nerve damage related to heart disease , cancer , cataract , stroke , diabetes.
Alpha lipoic acid increases the level of glutathione.
RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX V_VM PR_PRQ N_NN N_NN N_NN 
In some food substances very little quantity of alpha lipoic acid is found example lettuce , meat , potato etc.
In the suggested dose 100 mg quantity of alpha lipoic acid with food , 200 mg everyday can be taken by people suffering with diabetes.
What is the sufficient quantity of nutritive substances ? 
In 1941 American Food and Nutrition Board decided the quantity of various types of nutritive substances after guessing the quantity of nutritive substances , the protection of body through nutritive substances , through figures after studying the scientific history.
For each type of nutritive substance the board has decided recommended dietary allowance RDA which is 98 % diet for healthy people , which the body can easily accept.
Tolerable Upper Intake Level UL - is that quantity of nutritive substance which a healthy person can consume everyday without any harm.
Only in some cases the board could not decide yet that how much quantity of nutritive substance would be beneficial or harmful.
How to choose antioxidants for fighting the diseases.
Whenever you buy fruits and vegetables , keep in mind that you choose only those whose color is bright.
As much bright the color of the fruits and vegetables that much more would be the antioxidants.
Apart from this there are more antioxidants in fresh fruits in comparison to canned , cultured or heated food materials.
Generally if you consume food materials with little variation then you get more antioxidants.
Like in comparison to green colored or white colored grapes antioxidants are found more in red grapes.
In comparison to white onion red and yellow onions are more antioxidant rich.
Cauliflower , cabbage raw or light cooked broccoli is highly rich in antioxidants.
In green and grinded garlic much antioxidant is found.
In comparison to canned vegetables fresh and frozen vegetables are richer in antioxidants.
In place of boiled or steam cooked vegetables the vegetables cooked in microwave is richer in antioxidants.
Dark green leafy vegetables are highly rich in antioxidants.
In place of juice whole fruits are rich in antioxidants.
In place of canned juice fresh and cold juice is good source of antioxidant.
Dark orange colored carrot , gourd and sweet potato are substances rich in more antioxidants.
Being scared is also mental disease.
The person suffering from phobia knows that his fear is meaningless and not correct , but then also he is not able to keep control over it.
The disease of being scared has been found more in women.
Generally this problem arises between 20 to 30 years.

In the disease of agoraphobia the person is extremely scared of such places and he stops going to these places.
If by chance also he faces such situations then he starts feeling very scared and helpless.
On the situations becoming serious the symptoms of rapid breathing , cold limbs , shivering , sweating , increase in heart beat , stomach pain , dryness of the mouth etc.
many times the person starts feeling such , as if his life will come out now.
If in such situation the patient is present with any of his dear ones then his fear gets reduced a bit.
Specific phobia is not considered so serious.
In specific phobia much difficulties do not arise in the daily life of the person.

For example the fear more than usual arising out of cockroach , cat , lizard , river , bright light , noise , blood , skyscrapers etc.Come under this category.
The problem of fear in some people also arises due to genetic reasons.
In some people the genes of this disease comes from parents which gives rise to the problem of fear on getting negative environment.
The appearance of the problem of fear in the blood relatives of people suffering from this increases in comparison to general people.
In order to be free from the fears the mind keeps putting it in unconscious mind so that it can feel relaxed after forgetting the worries.
Without any effort the person put his worries in the unconscious mind and feels at peace.
But many times the mind fails to suppress his worries in mind and suffers from the problem of fear.
Those children who become scared more than usual when separated from there mother even for short while , become victim of phobia later on.
Good sleep keeps man fresh mentally and physically.
Apart from this in order to keep other activities of memory and brain function smoothly sufficient sleep is very essential.
People who take less sleep need sleep of 6 hours or less than this everyday.
Even on taking less sleep they do not face any type of problem and they stay absolutely alright mentally and physically.

The problem of delusional disorder generally starts after the age of 30 years of age.
The feeling of doubt may also arise in people who do intoxication by consuming alcohol , cannabis , chars , marijuana , sleeping pills.
Some medicines used for the treatment of other diseases like steroids , amphetamines , thyroxin , isonaizide etc may also lead to the growth of the feelings of doubt as well.
Mental shock arising suddenly like - death of dear one , loss in business , being fired from job , theft , social disgrace etc leads to the growth of mental disorder named acute psychosis in some people.
In psychosis as well the mind of the person becomes of suspicious type.

The patient feeling such as if the newspaper , TV and radio people are publishing news about him or else telling his thoughts to everyone.
Keep in mind that it is not essential that all these symptoms should be present in one patient.
In various patients the symptoms of this disease may be different.
Till now the actual reasons of the disease of schizophrenia has not been known accurately , but some understood reasons are this way -.
Hereditary reason - if any of mother - father have the disease then it can go to the child through genes.
the chance of this disease in the blood relatives of the patient increases slightly in comparison to others.
Some chromosomes like 5 , 11 , 18 , 19 and X have been found to be related to this disease.
The chemical change in the brain - the error in dopamine , serotonin and other chemicals of the brain in some parts of the brain may become reason of this disease.
the medicine given for the treatment of this disease corrects this error thereby getting control over it.
Mental tension more than necessary may also give rise to the disease of schizophrenia.
On the increase of tension those people become the victims of the disease who already from before have the possibility of the occurrence of this within.
Often in India schizophrenia disease is considered to be the effect of magic , eternal rage or evil spirit.
Due to which reason the patient is first taken to the black magicians and absurd treatment is done.
Due to this reason right treatment is not received on time and the condition of the patient becomes serious.
Schizophrenia has also taken into its capture great personalities , artists and scientists.
After being inflicted by the disease of schizophrenia he had to leave his job.
But with the help of his wife and continuous treatment Nash became healthy enough and was successful in getting his job.
Mania is one such psychological disorder in which the person goes into the state of euphoria.
Mania disease is the inverse of depression.
In depression where the person becomes sad , lethargic and weak there in mania he starts staying excited more than usual.
Every person 's mood keeps changing with time.
Like at times he stays happy and at times sad.
The change of mood is a normal experience.
But when this mood starts staying happy or sad more than required and starts putting bad impact on the normal life of the person then it is the sign of psychological disorders like mania or depression.
Mania disease can occur both in men and women.
Children have also been seen becoming victim of mania.
Around one out of hundred people is inflicted with mania.
The main symptom of mania disease is staying excited and happy more than required.
Every time staying angry and in rage.

If the treatment of this condition is not done then this stage of mania may continue to stay generally for 4 to 5 months.
Once on the occurrence of the disease of mania there is always a risk of its occurrence in the future especially , if proper treatment is not done.
After the state of mania is corrected some patients continue to suffer with the feeling of self pity and crime.
Many times depression and mania start appearing in one patient only.
Once the patient suffers from mania and second time from depression.
This type of mental disorder is also known by the name of swing maniac depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.
In India the patient suffering with mania continues to suffer from this disease for long time.
On not getting the right treatment many types of problems like heavy loss in business , disharmony in mutual relations , legal problems , argument with fellow workers and officers , family problems etc.surround such people badly.
Can the attack of mania come again ? 
Yes of course , the attack of mania can come again in the life of the person suffering from mania.
In the situation of no treatment many attacks can come second time in the life of the person suffering with mania.
The attacks occurring in the future may also be of depression.
After how long second attacks would come or else how serious they would be it is slightly difficult to say all these for certain.
But it has been seen that , as the age increases the attacks also start occurring frequently and their seriousness also go on increasing.
Through proper treatment the occurrence of the attack of mania can be stopped.
Some conditions related to the disease of mania are mix type , rapid cycler , ultra rapid cycler.
In the person suffering with mix type disorder the symptoms of depression and mania are present simultaneously.
For example on one hand the person is working with great pace and enthusiasm , but inside his view towards life would be negative.
In rapid cycler disorder the person starts becoming the victim of mania or depression at least four times within a year.
In the ultra rapid cycler disorder the symptoms of depression and mania keep changing fast among themselves at the interval of some hours or days.
The ultra rapid cycler patient starts feeling sad after staying unusually in happiness for some hours.
This sadness of ultra rapid cycler patient starts changing fast again after some time.
This is thing of surprise that the mood of person also can be the victim of disease.
The patient suffering with ultra rapid cycler at times starts becoming sad in the form of depression and at times uncontrollably happy in the state of mania.
The loss of mental capacity occurring in the old age more than 60 years due to which excessive reduction starts coming in the memory , intelligence , prudence , the capacity to learn new and the capability to adjust according to new situations of the person.
All these symptoms are the signal of the disorder of dementia psychological delusion.
Although with increase in age reduction starts coming in the mental and physical capacity of every person.
This reduction does not produce any major difficulty in the normal life of the person.
For example if 65 year old person at times forgets the name of any relative or an object after keeping it somewhere , then it is not essential that this problem is the signal of disease.
On putting some pressure he even remembers those situations again.
But the patient of the dieses of dementia starts forgetting more than required and losses the ability to remember again.
In dementia the person is forced to behave like children.
The child though with age develops his mental capabilities , but the condition of the patient suffering with the disease of dementia becomes serious with increase in age.
there are two reasons for the dementia disease.
The first reason is the contraction of brain.
This happens due to the disease named Alzheimer.
In Alzheimer due to the death of the cells of brain the size of the brain starts decreasing.
Together with this the chemical named acetilcolinesterase also starts decreasing in brain.
The second reason is the accumulation of the clots in the transmitters of blood providing nutrition to brain.
In India among all the reasons of dementia this is a major reason.
The symptoms of the disease do dementia are as follows -.
Lack of memory , difficulty in remembering new things.
Arising of problems in remembering date , telephone number and the account of money.
Gradually forgetting old things.
In dementia produced due to the disease named Alzheimer the loss of memory takes place very slowly about which many times for up to several years there is no knowledge.
Loss in the awareness of place and time for example considering morning as evening , to start using kitchen as bathroom , forgetting the way to home etc.
Forgetting the names of things found nearby like on showing the spectacles not able to say what it is.
Purchasing unnecessary things from market.
Changes in personality like staying silent more than required or else the growth of very irritable or doubting nature.
Such symptoms are seen in 30 percent patients of dementia.
Repeating one thing repeatedly , talking nonsense , cracking joke untimely , putting on clothes weirdly , keeping things here and there.
Reduction in the ability to do fundamental things like bathing , wearing clothes , eating etc.
Losing control on oneself suddenly.
Becoming restless , shouting and fighting in anger.
Shitting in clothes or even in open.
Such often occurs in the last stages of dementia disease.
Difficulty in speaking , dizziness , loss of weight , difficulty in sleep etc symptoms also may arise in dementia disease.
All these symptoms should be present in a patient together such is not essential.
Every patient of dementia may have his own different symptoms.
If this disease is due to the reason of the disease named Alzheimer then the death of patient occurs between 1 to 20 years.
On the occurrence of this disease before 50 years its more serious form comes forward.
The ex president of America Ronald Reagan had also become the Vitim of this disease only.
In the film Black Amitabh Bachchan has been shown to be suffering from this disease only.
God knows how many women and girls due to not being able to express straight the complexes of the mind , suppressed desires , problems and difficulties exhibit in the form of hysteria.
Even after tiring to know intensely , many times it becomes difficult to know the matters on their mind and this problem goes on continuing for long time.
In one way the problem of hysteria is the voice of the mind.
Generally the meaning of hysteria is considered in the form of the onset of bots of unconsciousness.
But there are many types of hysteria.
Due to ignorance this myth is popular pervasively that this disease occurs due to the effect of various supernatural powers , ghost , spirits , souls of dead etc.
Actually hysteria disease occurs due to the reason of the problems happening at the mental level.
In India hysteria disease is found more in married women.
the disease of hysteria is found in children from 5 years to even men.
The chance of the occurrence of the disease of hysteria is the maximum between the age of 10 up to 30 years.
In psychiatry hysteria is known by the name of dissociative disorder.
The symptoms of the disease of hysteria are as follows.
Occurrence of seizures - in this various types of symptoms can occur together or separately.
Like breathing rapidly or with difficulty , throwing limbs here and there in air , staying unconscious for many hours , tightening of fist , the pupils continuing to move after the closing of eyes etc.

Theatrical hysteria - in this the patient conducts as if in him there is the residing of any god , spirit or ghost and the powers of giving boon or punishment have come in him.
That time the voice of the patient also changes.
Big crowd of audience get surrounded near him and people ask for favors from him.
Paralysis - in this the condition of weakness appears in one or more organs like in hand , foot , shoulders etc.
Whose relation is not with any physical deformity or disease even.
At times there is such feeling as if the body organ has stopped working.
Many times for doctor also differentiating between actual paralysis and hysterical paralysis becomes difficult.
Dumbness and noiselessness - in these conditions the patient is not able to speak anything.
But without any problem he can whisper , can do his talking by writing or gesturing through hands.
On investigation all the organs of the patient of hysteria like the tongue , lips , sound cord etc are found to be working in normal way.
Why does hysteria arise ? 
The mind complicated by some problem when fails to find any solution then the situation of a mental conflict arises.
In such situation if any person is not able to face his mental strife or is not able to express his problem in any way then the suffering mind finds the way to escape from his problems or to express them through hysteria.
Often women due to social and domestic situations are not able to express their desires and feelings and consequently many types of internal conflict arise in their mind.
These conflicts continuing in the sub - conscious mind become the reason of hysteria.
Hysteria is completely the game of sub - conscious mind.
The addiction of intoxication is also the disease of mind.
The biggest problem is this that those people who do intoxication they themselves do not know whether they are the victim of addiction or not.
One person who takes eight - ten pegs of alcohol only four or five times in a month he assumes that the addiction of alcohol has occurred to him.
On the other hand that person who takes half bottle of alcohol every night and can not sleep without drinking , says to himself that no - no I am not drunkard , drunkards are of different kind altogether.
I drink only some , that also while sleeping.
The person does the intoxication of anything and to him any of the three things out of six things given underneath apply to him then assume that he has been addicted or used to for intoxication.
Intense desire to take intoxicating substance.
Repeatedly failing in the attempts to quit intoxication.
Arising of physical and mental problems on the unavailability of intoxication like the shivering of limbs on not getting alcohol , not getting sleep or getting restless.
Gradual increase in the quantity of intoxication because after some time the effect of the previous quantity starts reducing.
For example the person doing smack intoxication in some months from half gram smack his coming to two gram smack.
Wasting a lot of time in the consumption of intoxicating substances.
The person ignoring the other aspects of his life like socializing , doing his work , care of the children etc.
Intoxication is harming the body , despite knowing this continuing intoxication.
For example despite jaundice and vomiting blood not stopping the consumption of alcohol.
Apart from this other symptoms like intoxication in solitude , harm to the physical and mental health , taking intoxication in large quantity in one go etc are also the signals of the problem of intoxication.
Beer , whisky , champagne , vodka , rum , gin , brandy , alcohol , country made alcohol etc come in the category of alcohol.
In the category of tobacco bidi , cigarette , cigar , tobacco powder etc.
Canabis - charas , marijuana , sulpha , hashish all these substances are obtained from the plant of canabis hemp.
Sleeping pills like - diazepam , nitrozapam , alprazola alprex etc.
Opium related substance - opium , smack , brown sugar , capsules proxivon and spasmovon , the pills of lomotil etc.
Other substances - amphitamin , L.S.D.Solvent petrol , eraser fluid , polish etc cocaine , tea , coffee etc.
Tea , coffee are also in fact intoxicating substances , but due to not being much harmful they have been accepted on the social basis.
Being mentally or physically dependent on substances affecting the activities of body and brain is only called the addiction of intoxication.
The addiction of intoxication has been considered a mental disorder.
The Indians alone drink approximately 120 crore litre of alcohol during a year.
The consumption of alcohol in India is continuously gaining strength.
If the drunkard is able to quit alcohol foursome months then it is good riddance , because during this his body and liver gain strength as earlier.
But if the liver has become absolutely bad then even after quitting alcohol it does not become alright.
For the patient it is very difficult to quit alcohol on his own is very difficult.
for this a lot of will power is needed which is formed in very few people.
Some people think that by gradually reducing the quantity of alcohol one day I will completely quit it in fact such people deceive themselves.
Like this it is nearly impossible to quit the addiction of alcohol.
In order to get rid of this problem it is extremely important to take the advice of the psychiatrist.
People in whom there is no internal desire to quit alcohol , their family members should certainly meet their closest psychiatrist once.
many times the work appearing difficult is in fact easy.
Through some methods in such addicted people producing the internal desire to quit drinking may be tried.
To treat addiction two method are used one is through medicines and second through behavioural treatment.
In the treatment through medicines some special medicines are started after completely stopping the alcohol of the patient.
After some days of this the patient and his family members are told about two different types of medicines.
One medicine helps in reducing the addiction of alcohol while the second medicine produces negative effect as the alcohol is consumed.
Due to this medicine reddening of the face , vomiting , breathlessness , restlessness , giddiness , fainting etc occur.
Due to the fear of these negative effects the person stops consuming alcohol.
In the behavioural treatment talking with patient , counselling , relaxation , exercise , desensitization , aversion therapy , group therapy etc are included.
Along with medicines behavioural treatment also has very important contribution in treatment.
No matter what the addiction is , after getting the treatment 60 - 70 percent people again start the intoxication within few months.
In such situation the patient and his family members should meet with his doctor again without feeling sad.
Today the main aim for the treatment of intoxication of the psychiatrists world over is to keep the person addiction free for long time after successful treatment.
If the person drinking alcohol more than required is not ready to stop alcohol completely or else is unsuccessful in doing this , then the consumption of alcohol in controlled way may be one way of treatment.
This method is determined after talking to the doctor.
Abstain from the quacks advertising the medicines for quitting alcohol without telling.
Never ever make the patient consume any such medicine , because due to these medicines if the patient consumes alcohol then due to negative effect reaction the patient may even die due to this.
Keep in mind that addiction also is the disease of mind only.
Other diseases like running nose , cold , cough may occur again similarly the addiction to intoxication may also occur again.
Therefore do not panic , take stem for repeated treatment.
Apart from the addiction of intoxication the addicted person may also become the victim of other mental problems like worry , depression , fear , suicide etc.
After leaving any intoxication its desire the intense desire to do intoxication troubles the person for some days.
This way after gaining control the desire to do intoxication dies gradually.
After the treatment the doubt of the family members on the behavior and conduct of the patient becomes the cause of complex for the patient.
Due to this in anger he can start the intoxication again.

The consumption of these pills is not any serious subject till the time its consumption is done according to the advice of the doctor.
The intoxication of tobacco is also like e mental disease just like other intoxications whose treatment is possible.
Among the cancer occurring to Indians 40 percent cancer is due to the reason of tobacco.
Every year due to the reason of smoking 8,00,000 people die.
At the time of quitting intoxication the desire produced for intoxication troubles maximum to the person at the time of quitting intoxication.
Once after the production of the desire of intoxication it stays for nearly 3 to 5 minutes.
To gain control over these desire of intoxication is little difficult , but not impossible.
After quitting the intoxication of tobacco it is natural process for the increase of 2 - 3 kilograms in the weight of the person.
On the increase of weight there is no need for any panic.

Abstain from such ignorant doctors , these methods may not necessarily be wrong , in the treatment of psychological disorders these techniques have chiefly proved to be unsuccessful.
In the initial stages of the disease of depression there is condition of mild mental tension and these methods show slight influence , then also it is considered to be the certified method of the correct treatment of mental diseases.

Through these words of Saumerset Maughm it becomes clear as to how important is the place of laughter in life.
Actually the person who does not have any place of amusement in his life he does not have to make any effort for becoming sad.
Without making any effort he can stay sad uninterrupted daily.

According to Bacon the jovial nature of person is the best means of longevity.
Tagore says whenever I laugh then the burden of my mind is lightened.
The secret of the popularity of Gandhiji was his love for fun.
Gandhiji writes laugh unties the knots of mind very easily.
Not of my mind alone but of your mind a well.
Laugh is one simple - natural process , but it is an amazing process.
This is one basic nature which is found only in humans.
It is said that person devoid of literature , music and art is like animal.
This thing is right to some extent but if seen on behavioural level then the person who does not use this gift of laughter endowed to man by nature then he is the biggest animal.
Human body is like a laboratory in which every moment biochemical and electromagnetic changes continue taking place.
As a result of these various changes man gets the feeling of happiness and pain.
Mind has deciding role in this.
According to our psychological state the bio - chemical structure of our body is only affected.
Optimistic psychological state has positive and negative psychological state has negative impact on the bio - chemical structure of our body.
Laughing is one such process which puts only positive effect on human body because in the process of laughing the role of mind becomes null or negligible.
The person laughing reaches to the state of no state that5 very moment which is the state of meditation only.
When you laugh then in those moments you reach to the state of deep thought or meditation on your own because at one time only laughing and meditation becomes impossible.
The meaning of laughter is to produce obstruction in thought process.
If you really laugh in reality then the thought process whether it is positive or negative stops immediately because at one time you do only one thing holistically.
Because of our incomplete activities our life becomes haphazard and imbalanced.
Therefore whatever action you do that in complete attention.
In laughter especially in the state of laughing heartily one is able to control the restlessness of the mind no matter if it is momentary.
That momentary control over the restlessness of the mind is an incredible incident.
For man it is beneficial situation for his good health.
Laughter is in fact a condition of instant yoga.

Not only in sports but in the matter of personality development and during motivational workshops as well the inclusion of laughter is must because after a good laugh the attention of the person becomes more concentrated and becomes centred on the subject again.
In everything literature , culture and art laughter is certainly present in some or the other form otherwise reader or subscriber would not be able to establish harmony.

In this entire process glow comes on the face.
The more one laughs and makes the other laugh that much more his face would glow.
The more the absorption of oxygen in the body that much more energy would be produced and as much energy is produced that much we will stay disease free.
This way laughter is the healing and nutritive element of life and it may also be called the essence of life.

Any religion has not thought of laughter ever.
Religion has always emphasized on seriousness and therefore all the world went on becoming sick psychologically.
Seriousness is a mental state produced from negative pont of view while laughter is a state obtained from positive point of view.
Through laughter throw away the coat of negative point of view or seriousness forever.
Leave making excuses and smile a little.
After this laugh and laugh strongly.
This only is the invaluable essence of life and the art of living the life with enthusiasm.
In homeopathy the treatment of esitinse disease has proved to be fruitful.

In esitinse disease water accumulates in the stomach.
This esitinse is seen in the disease of kidney , the disease of peritoneum , heart disease , sound system , self stopping fever , cancer , the diseases of blood vessels.
esitinse is not disease on its own , but this disease is seen in the guise of other diseases.

Why do we yawn ? 
According to Dr.D.Balasubramaniam there are many things in the daily life which are considered common but we do not have any explanation of these with us.
Yawning is one such thing.
If I see you yawning then why do I also start yawning ? 
Why is yawning like an infection ? 
Why do we start yawning a little time before going top bed and immediately after getting up ? 
Together with yawning why do we stretch ? 
Someone had said that yawning is like economics regarding which everyone has his one favorite explanation.
A very popular belief is this that we yawn then when we need more oxygen.
But it has been found that this belief about yawning is not correct.
Dr.Robert Provin of Maryland University is doing research on yawnings for long time.
Dr.Robert Provin made some people sit in the room and kept on changing the composition of air.
At first he made the volume of carbon dioxide 3 - 5 percent in the room and observed the rate of yawning in people.
After this he made the volume of carbon dioxide zero percent and once more the rate of yawnings were seen.
It has been seen that both the times the rate of yawnings dimension has been nearly equal.
Do we take more yawnings when we are tired ? 
No difference has been seen in the dimension of yawnings before the exercise , during and afterwards.
Does yawning have any relation with age ? 
It has been found that new born baby and even the foetus yawn.
During ultrasound inspection yawnings have been recorded in twenty weeks pregnancy.
It seems that this action is approximately as important as respiration , movement of eyes and parturition during birth.
This is an involuntary action on which the person does not have any control.
Yawning is not a simple action.
On average yawning is of 6 to 7 seconds.
During yawning the air is inhaled till deep and then released all of a sudden.
During yawning the heartbeat rate increases up to 30 percent and many types of nervous scientific changes occur in the brain.
It seems that the relation of yawning is to the attentiveness of waking up.
By this one understands as to why long spells of yawning comes to people suffering from nervous scientific problems epilepsy , multiple sclerosis.
It can be that yawning also does the work of a psychological pressure - release.
It is clear that yawning is not just the symbolism of boredom , sadness and the lack of oxygen alone.
On the basis of the nature of the disease , the availability of the related medicine and its process of effect the doctor prescribes the patient to take pills , injection and syrup according to the need.
Maximum medicines are available in all the three forms of pills , syrup solution , injection.
Then also there are many such allopathic medicines which are available in one form only.
Keeping the condition of the patient , age , condition of the disease and the effect of the medicine in sight the medicine is made to reach the body through the following media.
Through the mouth the medicine is given in the form of tablet pill , capsule , syrup solution.
The cover of capsule is made of gelatine which melts after going to the gall bladder.
With the name of medicines which are to be drunk you often read linctuses , mixture , emulsion.
From linctus the meaning is of that medicine which generally is in sweet solution.
Mixture is the solution of many medicines in water or in other chemicals.
In emulsion there are two solvents which generally becomes negligible.
The medicine of heart disease is placed on the tongue , which shows effect immediately by melting gradually.
This medium of taking the medicine is called ' sub lingual ' medium.
Injection and allopathic treatment have become the synonym of each other.
For giving glucose and other medicine fast into the body injection is given intravenous that is through the medium of arteries.
The veins visible on the outer part of the body take the deoxygenated blood towards the heart.
Opposite to this the arteries situated in the deeper parts of the body take the blood to the rest of the body from the heart.
In the arteries this blood flows with the speed of 65 kilometre per hour.
Then only the arteries are heard to be beating fast.
In general terms it only is called ' pulse '.
the second popular medium of giving injection is ' intramuscular ' that is giving injection in the muscles.
Generally injection is put on the upper or outer part of the arm or the upper part of the hips only.
Actually in both these places the nerves beneath the flesh is less.
If any nerve gets damaged through the needle of the injection then it can be lethal for the patient.
Apart from these popular methods there are ' subcutaneous ' and ' intradermal ' methods as well.
In these methods instead of putting the injection deeply in the flesh it is put at low depth beneath the skin.
The ' turbutaline ' injection in respiratory disease and ' insulin ' injection of diabetes is put through this method only.
In the subcutaneous method the effect of the medicine is slow.
Apart from this injection is also put in stomach peritoneal.In chect pectoral and spinal cord spinal.
In the diseases like asthma and cough the patient takes in some medicine by inhaling through breathing.
The medicine to make unconscious during surgery ether is also given through this medium alone.
In the medium of local application ointment , balm , oil etc are applied in body pain , warts , injury , itching atc on the essential places.
The ointment applied on the nose , ear and eyes and glycerine etc applied on mouth ulcers also come under this category alone.
How does the medicine show its effect ? 
The medicines given through the injection enter the blood flow directly only.
Therefore the effect also is quick and pervasive.
The medicines taken through mouth digest with the food in gall bladder and intestines.
The intestines fail to absorb these medicines completely.
If they stomach is empty then the oral medicines show more effect.
The medicine absorbed through the intestines goes to the liver through the ' postal vessel '.
If the functioning of the liver is not alright then maximum medicines become inactive.
various types of enzymes affect the chemical activities of the medicines.
From the liver the medicine goes to the heart and from there through the pumping action it sends the blood to every cell of the body.
The medicine travels in the entire body through the plasma available in the blood.
These medicines finally mix with the fluid available outside the cell and show their effect wherever there is need of medicines.
After the consumption the remaining medicine is excreted through the urine after reaching the kidney from the heart through the medium of the excretory parts of the cells.
Therefore during the excretion of some medicines the color of the urine appears to be yellow , red or dark.
Which medicine stays in the body for how long and for how long it affects , on this basis alone the doctor prescribes the mode of taking the medicine to the patient.
Even after scholarly studies and researches the exact theory of the effect of the medicine has not been developed.
Receptor Theory ' proceeds by considering this that along with special tissues there is a construction named receptor in the body which attaches to and then speeds up as the medicine comes close to the tissue.
The second theory is of ' antimetaolitis ' , according to which the cells acquire their nutrition from special type of elements.
The antibacterial medicines too possess the shape of nutritive elements.
As such the microbes etc consider these as nutrition and their growth stops.
Finally the microbes die and the patient become alright.
Enzymes are those elements , which are helpful in fastening the various chemical activities in the body.
Some enzymes do the work of ferrying the liquid inside and outside of the cells.
Some medicines are capable of affecting the general nature of these enzymes and the functioning cells.
Allopathic medicines are made of various types of plants , minerals , chemicals and the body of animals.
These medicines show effect according to the nature of the specific disease.
Some medicines fulfil the deficiency of special elements in the body while some deactivate the chemicals which have increased.
Similarly some medicines provide speed to the activities of the body while some finish off the growing microbes.
Due to this reason alone the side effects ill effects of English medicine is also very much.
Not sleep , the base of the entire health is yoganidra.

Handicappedness is an extremely ancient and omnipresenet problem.
The people of all the parts , religions and communities of the world get affected with handicappedness more or less.
Everyone male - female , rich - poor can be the victim of handicappedness.
With time change has come in the appearance of this problem of handicappedness.
Today control has been achieved to very great extent on measles , reasons of blindness at birth , leprosy , polio etc.
The cases of cerebral palsy and mental retardation are increasing.
The spread of education in handicaps is also increasing and the understanding of people towards handicappedness is also becoming positive.
Technical development has provided artificial reading power to blind people , better hearing power to deaf people , improved movement to skeletally handicapped people.
The development of medical science has prevented the growth of diseases and put reins on the process of conversion of diseases on handicappedness.
The spreading of education among handicapped people is increasing due to the efforts of Indian government , state governments and self help organizations.
Today the situation has come to this that by providing suitable environment and extra facilities the handicapped people can be included in the mainstream of society.
By providing obstruction free environment we can provide them with opportinity to become respected citizens.
Now instead of becoming burden on the society the handicapped people may come in the condition of contributing to the society.
Computer , information technology , automation have made working for handicapped people very simple.
Now in comparison to normal people handicapped people may contribute better.
The weakening of any part of body , situation arising due to deformation is called handicappedness.
Before understanding handicappedness well it is essential to understand the various organs and their working.
The ability of sight plays important role in our life.
Most of our activities are possible because of our reason of seeing.
The various types of deformities occuring in eyes become the reason of vision imparement.
How much is the vision impairement this a specialist doctor can tell only after complete check up but there is also an easy method of testing it.
If a person is not able to count the fingers of a person standing at the distance of three metres then he can be considered visually impaired.
The complete investigation of visually impaired person is essential.
A big part of the eye ball is white.
This white part maintains the shape of the eye and also protects its fragile construction.

Hearing impairment is that condition in which child or adult is incapable of hearing partially or in complete form.
There are many types of hearing impairment.
Many times outer and middle ear fail to transmit sound to the inner ear.
In such situation the person faces difficulty in hearing.
One more reason for this can be this that dirt gets accumulated in the canal of the ear.
Apart from this deformity in the construction of the bones of the ear , injury or because of the reason of any disease also it can happen.
The reason of other type of deafness can be the deformity in the inner ear.
The more the deformity , more is the loss of hearing ability.
In the innere ear place is decided for every frequency.
In the inner ear the loss at any frequency becomes less and on some it becomes extremely high.
There are many reasons of this type of deformity but generally due to the reason of damage of the minute construction of cochlea this deformity takes birth.
In some children due to the damage occuring in cochlea the ability to bear loud noise gets destroyed.
The more the damage becomes the ability of child to recognize words become that much less.
When the damage occurred in the cochlea it does not get corrected through treatment and surgery then there is no other way leaft apart from wearing the hearing aid.
If the pregnant woman suffers from from viral fever , influenza , chicken pox , mumps etc in the first trimester then the child in the womb can be adversely affected.
The child in the womb can also become deaf.
In childhood diseases like meningitis , jaundice , typhiod , measles can put adverse effect on the hearing ability of the person.
The complications during birth like foreceps delivery can have influence on the ear.
Continuous flow of water and pus may also become the reason of becoming deaf.
If the pregnant woman eats unnecessary medicine without the consult of the doctor for abortion or any disease then there could be adverse effect on the foetus and it may also become deaf.
There are two ways of safety from deafness.
First way is this that one should stay away from those diseases which give birth to deafness.
Second this that if there has been the influence of this disease then it should be prevented from being converted to handicappedness.
The useful instrument used for hearing in deaf people is basically a small electronic appliance.
This electronic appliance is also called a minute mike.
Through this electronic appliance or minute mike the sound can be amplified many times.
Speaking is actually a special process which differentiates us from other organisms.
If by 15 months the child is not able to speak meaningful word then it is essential to get him tested.
If by this age the child starts speaking words like mummie , papa then there is no reason to worry.
If the voice of the child is abnormal , heavier , or comes with obstruction then also it is essential to get it c hecked up.
During management program the exercises for the growth of child is being done.
During management plan the activities of daily life are taught.
The child is taught to speak , move etc under the management plan.
Under this the difficulties of the children are solved and the treatment of the diseases are also done.
Some activities among these take place in hospital or rehabilitation center and some take place at home alone.
The activities which take place at home are demonstrated to the mother - father and important instructions are given to be repeated at home.
According to the American Association of Mental Retardation that person is called mentally retarded who is not able to do his simple activity.
The measurement of intelligence is less than 70 and bothe these problems start affecting the person from the age of 18 years only.
From 0 - 6 years the child learns to stand up , walk , run , eat , wear clothes , use toilet , keep clean , to converse etc.
From 6 years to 12 years of age the child learns to read - write , talk meaningfully , to help etc.
From 12 to 18 years of agethe child learns to do all his domestic work and lears to use hospital , post - office , public vehicle , phone etc.
The child acquires skill in sports and entertaining activities as well.
the child learns to do useful work as well.
That child whose growth rate is less than the above mentioned rate he is considered to be mentally retarded.
Intelligence measurement scale is a method to measure intelligence prepared by the scientists.
The average IQ of man is from 90 to 110.
If the IQ is between 70 to 89 then the man can lead satisfactory life.
If the IQ is less than 70 then the man is considered to be mentally retarded.
On the IQ being less than 70 it becomes essential to pay attention to him.
If the IQ is between 52 to 69 then the man is considered to be less mentally retarded.
The man with IQ between 36 to 51 is considered to be average mentally retarded.
If the IQ is between 20 to 35 then he is considered to be extremely mentally retarded.
The people with IQ less than 19 are considered to be extremely serious.
Making a mentally retarded child recognize himself and learn his own name is an art in itself.
For this during all the activities of the menatlly retarded child like bathing , changing clothes , eating , playing etc.his name should be called.
Apart from this after showing the reflection of the child in mirror his name should be called out so that he can recognize himself.
For making the mentally retarded child learn to drink milk at first he is made to sit in front of the mirror and shown to hold the glass.
The child becomes happy by seeing himself in the mirror drinking milk.
Initially the child has to be given support but later on the child the child starts drinking on his own.
People who are mentally ill are entirely different from mentally retartded people.
The IQ of the person mentally ill is average or more than average.
The growth of the person mentally ill also takes place normally.
These people are victims of the psychological disorder and become alright through medicine or psychological treatment.
Due to psychological disorder their feelings become deformed and along with it effect is seen on the intelligence as well.
The persons mentally ill generally become alright after treatment and lead normal life at home.
Those people who do not get alright and do dangerous activities , they are kept at mental hospitals.
If the hands of the person are incapable then he would considered to be the victim of the impairement of the upper skeleton.
If the legs are incapable then he would be considered to be the victim of impairement of lower skeletan.
There are many reasons of skeletal impairment and some among these start from pregnancy itself.
Many diseases occurring to the pregnant mother become the cause of handicapedness in the child in the womb.
Many times from the time of birth the hands or feet of the child remain underdeveloped or are not there at all.
In such situation the person does maximum work with the help of assisting instruments or artificial organs.
Many times the loss of hands can be fulfilled with legs and the loss of legs with hands.
The legs of many children are twisted and deformed from birth.
Attempt should be made to straighten such deformed feet as soon as possible because the bones and joints of children are soft.
Cerebral palsy is one of the deformities occurring from birth and is sufficiently dangerous.
Due to the damage occurring in the brain some organs of the brain stop functioning.
Jaundice is a major reason of cerebral palsy.
In the state of jaundice one can be saved from this situation by giving blood to the child as soon as possible.
High fever , vommitting etc occurring in new born baby become the causes of cerebral palsy.
Apart from this many children become victims of T.B.
The condition of cerebral palsy persists life long because there is no treatment for this.
But on the other side if correct opportunities are provided to the suffering child then to sufficient extent he can become responsible and a man of independent personality.
In the management of child suffering with cerebral palsy the role of parents and guardian is important.
Therefore for preparing parents for this work continuous consult and support should be given.
The guardians must be shown the way to recognize specialities of the child and to help and support them in order to fulfil their deficiencies.
There is also the need of special instruments to the child suffering with cerebral palsy.
With these instruments the children suffering with cerebral palsy are able to do many types of work easily.
Muscular dystrophy is one such disease in which the muscles continue becoming weak gradually.
Muscular dystrophyis of three types.
In the first type of the disease of muscular dystrophy the growth of the child occurs at first normally or a little gradually.
When the child is of 2 - 3 years then he faces difficulty in walking , strolling , running , climbing etc.
Later on in muscular dystrophy difficulty comes in standing as well.
After some days the child is forced to stay lying on the bed.
In the other types the rate of the muscular dystrophy disease is less or more.
T.B.is of many types , bones and joints also become its victim.
Due to the reason of T.B.the rotation of the joints stops.
If T.B.reaches to the spinal cord then hunch comes out and paralysis may attack.
In India around one and half crore people are affected with T.B.And one fourth among these have become the victim of handicappedness.
The disease of lathyrism is a disease that occurs due to excessive use of grasspea.
Grasspea is cheap and is eaten by the poor class in the large area of Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Orissa.
Due to the use of grasspea first the person feels weakness in walking and then becomes obligated to take the prop of a stick.
Despite ban this grasspea is still eaten.
During to handicappedness there is much more psychological damage than the physical damage.
In fact with the information of handicappedness a very big shock is received to the person.
If we see from the scientific point of view then all the parts of our body work independently.
The effect of a bad or inactive organ is not seen on the other healthy organs.
There are very few such diseases which show effect on other organs together.
Therefore it may be believed that the reproductive organs of the handicapped person would be normal.
He can keep his partner happy by using his reproductive power and can fulfil family duties.
Those women who have damaged spinal cord they can also become pregnant.
During pregnancy the women with damaged spinal cord may have to face various types of complications.
These complications are untimely pain , ulcer due to pressure etc.
Because of the spinal cord being damaged these women fail to feel the movement of the foetus.
The delivery in such women is possible through foreceps and other other methods.
There is no difficulty to deaf and dumb in walking.
Menatlly retarded or people suffering from psychological disorders also walk easily.
There is heavy difficulty to blind people and skeletally handicapped people in movement.
There is need of training for walking to blind people and skeletally handicapped people.
In new blind people there is huge lack of confidence.
Newly blinds become anxious on slight problem and in anxiety fail to even go for little approximation.
Therefore for such blind people the training of movement is that much essential as the learning of braille.
Blind person can recognize objects to very great extent with touch.
Blind person can estimate by touching by using hands or feet.
Blind person can estimate many things by smelling inside or outside the home.
On the basis of smell the blind person estimates many shops , factories or offices.
When we walk then the effect of the forthcoming obstacles is seen on our muscles and joints.
By this also we come to know to great extent as to where we are walking.
Different types of places grassy , road , sandy area or an area filled with mud puts different types of effects on the muscles and joints of our feet.
Similarly while traveling in bus , climbing up the stairs or while opening the doors our muscles feel differently.
On the basis of these fellings the blind can come to know of his situation and direction.
The person with sight should stand in front of the blind person.
The blind person should hold the arm of the blind person by standing one step back.
The skeletally challenged person also is made to learn movement.
After the sudden skeletal handicappedness where its physical capacity decreases , there its confidence also shatters.
In such while the skeletally challenged person is need of assisting instruments to move , there he also needs someone to give the right directions.
Stick is the oldest assisting instrument in which there is the use of straight wood.
On the upper part of the stick there is one handle.
At present there is also the use of aluminium stick which is light and strong.
Below this aluminium tip there is rubber tip which keeps a good hold on the floor.
When wheels are attachd to the normal chair then it is called wheel chair.
After sitting on this chair the victim of serious handicappedness also can come up to some distance.
Motorised wheel chair for going inside and outside of house and office are also available which have brakes as well.
At present the complaint of contamination in things for eating and drinking are becoming common.
Ghee , oil , milk , spices and in fact in vegetables as well as the use of chemicals is a serious problem.
Certainly by consuming contaminated things we are straight away inviting diseases.
The chemicals mixed in these contaminated things affect our immune system directly , by which the problems of dehydration , vomiting etc may occur.
This way by the use of substances mixed with these chemicals there is a risk of the occurrence of the diseases connected to nervous system etc.
With contaminated things not just liver , but the effect is also seen on intestines.
We can overcome this problem , provided we stay cautious.
In order to stay away from the ill effects of contaminated food materials we must at first try to buy goods of good quality.
An alternative from being saved from contaminated food materials may be branded items , but many times complaints may arise even in them.
Therefore for you organic foods would be safe.
The biggest benefit of organic food products is this that no type of chemical substances can be used in them.
On the other hand the complaint of the mixing of fruits and vegetables and the use of chemicals to ripen them is also coming forward regularly.
This may also prove harmful with respect to health.
As such from the point of view of safety you must eat the fruit after peeing them off.
Similar things you can do with vegetables as well.
Not just this , you wash fruits and vegetables many times before use , so that , more and more color on them gets washed.
Just nutritive food is not essential , but staying cautious is also essential so that the chemicals do not go inside with nutrition in the body.
The problem of handicappedness is ancient and the efforts of their diagnosis are also equally ancient.
The level of technical dvelopment has been having continuous influence on these efforts.
The National institute for the Visually Handicapped have developed various types of assisting instruments for various purposes.
For the higher education of handicapped people latest braille slates , tailor 's frame , instruments to solve numericals and algebra , and kit helpful in geometry have also been prepared.
For the handicapped persons the set of pictures helpful in the study of physics have also been developed.
With the help of all these assisting instruments related to education the blind person can read new and every type of subjects.
For general blind persons tools for threading a needle , for shorthand etc have also been developed.
For the physical development and the entertainment of blind people many things of games have also been developed.
For the blind people the ringing balls in cricket and football etc have been developed.
Tactile chess for sitting down and playing , cards of braille , pocket frame etc have been manufactured.
For the locomotion of blind people the stick which is brought in use have also been developed.
Although the braille script has been of support for the blind people from long time but with time improvements have come in this as well.
Now one after the other such machines have come in which the typing of braille takes place as fast as possible.
The person types normal words on the computer and simultaneously the attached machine continues taking out the print in braille.
Now in less time newspaper , letters , magazines or books can be prepared.
Where such machines are being imported from foreign institutions there in India as well many organizations are doing research in this direction.
Voice synthesizer has also become common now and has become available in less price.
Whatever is fed into the computer , the attached voice synthesizer reads it aloud.
Previously the blind people used to get scared with calculation and maths.
now after the invention of voice calculator not just the anxiety of the blind people has vanished , but now they can also work at the place of calculations.
At present in our country there is adequate arrangement of making artificial leg or calliper etc according to severed legs or weak legs.
The leg is severed below the knee or above , the artficial leg can be fixed.
similarly to whatever extent of the leg is weak or distorted the callipers can be prepared and these are very helpful.
These callipers can be worn for many years easily.
In order to make club foot straight initially and or the making of special shoes according to them is also easy.
When the person becomes handicapped after becoming victim of a disease or accident then his treatment is done in various ways.
Among these various types of surgical treatment , physical treatment , physiotherapy , occupational therapy etc are included.
At present to great extent benefit has been observed in various cases of polio , leprosy , accidents.
In the country there is a web of the centres of ALIMCO and Mahavir Handicapped Institute where every type of artificial organ and calliper etc are available.
Through the surgical treatment the effort of making the patients of cerebral palsy normal is ongoing.
Due to the development in medical science the lost eye sight is retieved once again and the diseases do make the person blind.
The biggest example of this is earler people in large numbers used to become blind due to cataract.
Now with simple surgery the treatment of cataract is done.
Through the intra occular lens the person continues to take benefit of the complete sight capacity.
At present with the surgery transparency is brought back.
In the schools through the regular treatments of children prevention is applied on the diseases of eyes and the increasing diseases are corrected.
In various cases when the person starts living his life after considering himself blind then with the surgery of cornea he starts seeing.
Organisations like Mahavir Vikalang Sahayata Samiti have provided artificial organs to people by visiting villages and investigating on large scale.
Similarly in such camps the surgery of cataract of the eyes of people has been done successfully.
One more solution of the diagnosis of the problem of handicappedness is this that so much facilities and concessions should be given to the handicapped people so that there could be sufficient compensation to the losses occurring due to physical disabilities.
According to the order issued by the Railway Ministry blind people , physically challenged , deaf - dumb and mentally retarded people would get 75 percent concession on the fares of first class , second class and sleeper class.
Also in season ticket the handicapped people get 50 percent concession.
Leaving deaf - dumb the assistants traveling with all the other type of handicaps also get this much concession.
In air travel only Indian Airlines gives 50 percent concession to the blind people.
In order to give more and more employment to the handicapped people they are provided with 7 percent reservation in dealership.
The handicapped people need assissting tools in order to carry out normal work.
Therefore poor handicaps should be given assistance to buy tools.
People with the monthly income of twelve hundred rupees get the aid equipments worth 3600 rupees.
Volunteer intitutions are given aids to educate children afflicted with cerebral palsy and mentally undeveloped children and for preparation of teachers and other experts to rehabilitate them.
In the same way institutions working for the rehabilitation of people after the treatment of leprosy and bringing them in the meanstream are also given up to 90 percent economical support.
The institutions that run special schools for the disabled people of different varieities are given economical aids up to 90 percent.
The districts which do not have special schools , this aid is given on a priority basis.
Besides this different aids programs are also run through district rehabilitation centres , regional rehabilitation centres.
Trachoma disease occurs due to a bacteria.
Trachoma disease gets spreading through the dirty hands , polluted towels etc..
Flies also play an important role in spreading trachoma disease.
Trachoma disease is more in those areas where poor people live and there is a plethora of dust.
The areas having a lack of water also have trachoma in plenty.
Open and dirty toilets , open sewers , twittering of the flies also increase the number of trachoma disease.
In trachoma disease there is burning in the eye and the eye waters.
Due to the disease of trachoma the eyes also get reddened.
In such situation it is essential to keep the eyes clean.
Also by taking the advice of the doctor the treatment of trachoma should be started.
In the pain of the neck in yogasana the neck should be moved backwards for treatment.
Gradually bend the neck forwards.
Let the chin touch the voice box.

In the pain of the neck move in open , fresh air.
The patients with neck pain should not do much mental work at the time of treatment.
Excess burden or tension should come on the neck , such work should not be done.
In the pain of neck tension free daily sleep of 6 - 8 hours is very essential.
In the pain of neck attention should be paid on the right posture of sitting and sleeping.
If the patients of neck pain are standing then they should stand erect.
During the situation of sitting the back of the patient of the neck pain should absolutely be staright.
The patient of the neck pain should use hard slab for sleeping.
Do not use pillow below the neck.
While doing any work the spinal cord of the patient should lay straight.
This way the patient of the neck pain should get quick relief by balanced diet , natural treatment.
Abstain from eating food in the roadside eateries.
They use low quality oil for many days.
Clear soup and green vegetable are helpful in increasing appetite.
Abstain from naan and rumali roti because maida is used in them.
In their place eat missi roti made of thick grains and fulke.
In food take only one gravy vegetable.
The meaning of more gravy in food is excess fat.
It is even said , little gravy is sufficient.
Choose one type of food.
To not complement bhel and kachori with chopsey and pork windalu with sambhar wada.
The diet of three dishes is sufficient.
Escape from diet of five dishes.
State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food.
In food take wine or water instead of cola.
Wine can complement with Indian food.
Cola can give rise to gas related problems.
Contaminated water or vapor rich water has ill effects on digestive system.
These days due to gas , bile and phlegm separately or by the combination of two or all the three several types of disease must be arising.
Therefore in monsoon season fire must be safeguarded cautiously.
Due to the subduction of fire there are lethal consequences on health.
Due to the deformation of fire the person suffers from many types of disease.
During rainy season one should abstain from the consumption of fire enhancing medicines , gas reducer and digestion enhancer medicines.
One should drink mixing the juice of lentil etc., old barley , wheat , shali rice , shadras , mastu , black salt , pippali , pippalamool , chavya , chitrak and sonth.
The water of well or rain or boiled water should be consumed.
During the days of excess rain sour , mineral rich and fragrant cereals should be used.
In dryness honey rich easily digestive substance should be consumed.
Take bath after applying fragrant oil etc , wear the clothes after using perfume etc.
The clothes should be kept in the sun from time to time.
In the medicine world among the various popular methods of treatment the place of natural treatment is important.
Our body is a self controlled active tool.
The God has made the arrangement of self defense , health safety inside our body itself.
That system in which there is method of staying free of disease by supporting nature , there are rules that only is called natural treatment.
When people feel restless and uncomfortable after becoming infested with indigestion , weakness and rot due to wrong life-style , incompatible and untimely food then to get rid of them they use various medicines , injections.
Through these medicines , injections even more dirt gets accumulated in the body.
The disease is not eliminated by medicnes.
One symptom of the complication gets suppressed and becomes the reason of another disease.
The body tries for its own defense.
The nature tries comprehensively to remove the dirt present in the body.
Naturopathy helps in removing and throwing away this dirt from our body.
Naturopathy makes the person healthy , strong and full of glow.
Fast , juice , fruits , balanced diet natural lifestyle are helpful in naturopathy.
With the method of air , sunlight - water , massage , exercise , pranayam any disease is destroyed from the root.
State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food.
Like in the villages as pollution arises in the drains and streets of villages disease is produced due to them.
Likewise dirt is accumulated in the body.
This dirt of the body can not be excreted through the medium of toilet , urine sweat etc and starts percolating inside.
That dirt of the body is the root of all the diseases.
If your disease is not able to be rectified by any medicine then get a new life by adopting new natural treatment.
Health is natural and disease is unnatural.
When we follow the rules of body and life then the health is natural.
When we ignore the rules of body and life , overlook then the disease is unnatural.
The normal reaction of the normal situation of life force is health and abnormal reaction is disease.
This condition of abnormal reaction is the reason of disease alone.
Therefore we can say that those symptoms because of which the situations of disease are produced they should be corrected.
No effort should be taken in order to suppress the symptoms through traditional contemporary method and medicines.
Traditional treatment method has always followed the short - term treatment policy.
The excess pressure of traditional treatment stays on treatment.
Traditional treatment method does not rely on the philosophy of staying free of disease.
We know that for the treatment of disease traditional treatment method has left no stone unturned in every possible research.
The treatment of disease depends on the basis as to in what form do we take our disease.
There is immense attack on the body in the form of medicine , injection etc.
By that action procedure the patient becomes disease free , this is the general belief among people.
On the basis of this wrong belief the use of all types of medicines are used on the diseases.
That is simple cough and cold or dangerous cancer disease.
The nature tries to maintain balance in the body.
In the human body health and disease are two separate self religions in the human body.
మానవ శరీరంలో ఆరోగ్యం మరియు రోగం రెండు భిన్నమైన స్వయంధర్మాలు.
But it definitely lays stress on the fact that by understanding the creative process of nature dependent rules certainly the people suffering with dangerous diseases can be helped.
The fact is that at present the extent to which people have the knowledge of destructive forces that much less they have the knowledge about the process of life force.
In the natural treatment the treatment is done of the patient and not of the disease.
On the occurrence of disease for the treatment of disease it is important to stick to the rules of health and essential to stay away from the habits which produce disease , matter and diet which produce the same.
By abiding by the rules of health only all types of diseases are cured.
By following the rules of health the treatment of the dangerous disease like cancer also is possible in the present times.
For the treatment of disease adopt any where and any type of method.
Eat medicines , but if you do not restricy yourself in food habits then the disease would not be corrected.
Someone consumes alcohol , is in the habit of smoking cigarette , bidi and his liver has become infectious , is suffering from rheumatism , arthritis , psyctic disease etc.
For these diseases the person eats different types of medicines.
Natural treatment is also done.
But if they do not quit alcohol , cigarette , bidi etc then one can not get rid of the disease.
By spending money of lacs and crores one can not free oneself of disease , till the time one does not follow the rules of health.
Natural treatment is proud that the treatment of all types of diseases is possible in natural treatment.
If the person will get the treatment done and do not quit the habits leading to disease , then is its treatment possible ? 
This is also true that if the person gets the treatment done by staying in any natural hospital , where he is given diet and treatment under strict vigilence.
The bad habits of the patient are removed with strictness.
In that duration of staying in hospital it is natural to get relief.
After coming back from the hospital again old habits , eating habits , and the rules of healthy life style are left , then again there is attack of the diseases.
The nature has given immense power to every living being to stay disease free.
In order to rid us from diseases modern scientific development makes us aware of the behavioural and non destructive enriched energy of the nature.
If once you become complete by the nature and follow its rules then you would always appear healthy and full of lively youth.
In order to maintain health balanced diet , self control , yoga and exercise are essential.
Good health is ultimate bliss.
The only key to health is the regular following of decided balanced diet by the diet specialists , and yogasana by the yoga specialists.
The secret to long life is in this only.
Not just long leaf , also of good health and youthful life.
It would be very justified to call the modern age as the pollution age , because at every step there is pollution.
Iron and steel industries , aviation , motor and railways , deafness of the ears due to the noise of loud - speakers etc , disorder of blood circulation , irritation due to staying in tension , beating of the heart , increase of blood pressure , diseases like cancer etc.
Diseases like tuberculosis , cancer , influenza , asthma , of throat and trachea etc are occuring due to the poisonous gases of motor cars and iron and steel industries and the spreading of pesticide chemicals in the plants in the fields.
The residents of those places where the atmosphere is covered with viruses , dust , smoke , moisture , fog and cloud are found to be suffering from tuberculosis , cancer , nervous weakness , rheumatism , blood disorders etc.
The effluents of poisonous pesticides , plastic , dye , and the factories of rubber the dirty drains of the city and the poisonous substances of chemical fertilizers are polluting the sources of water and the diseases like diarrhoea , piles and of skin are spreading.
In the pollution of the earth flies , mosquites and many harmful pests are being produced and are inviting the diseases like tuberculosis , gastritis , tetanus , yellow fever , malaria , dysentery , diorrhoea , cancer etc.
The edible items produced with chemical fertilizers make men and animals suffer from lethal diseases like cancer etc.
The use of various types of chemicals on plants and cereals produce many types of dangerous diseases after reaching in our body.
Due to the use of wrong utensils also the food items become poisonous.
Contamination by greedy businessmen and the use of saccharine in drinking items make the civilized men suffer from dangerous diseases.
There is more expenditure of life - force in digesting more food and elimination of disorders produced due to them.
By this its loss becomes definite.
One is required to work in order to lead life.
But rest is essential on getting tired.
Wandering uselessly , without any aim , tiring the one 's body is foolishness only and also with it there is also the reduction of life - force.
Due to staying idle the physical and mental powers start getting destroyed very fast.
Work is life , worklessness is death.
Flowing water is pure , but the water standing at one place only produces foul smell.
The brain of lazy , the house of disease.
Like due to not using the motor - car it gets rusted.
Due to working till late at night or partying or passing the entire night keeping awake wastage of life force is essential.
Due to keeping awake till late at night one can become the victim of mental disorder and sleeplessness etc.
According the view of Prof.A.Clark all our curing medicines are poison and as a result every dose of medicine reduces the life - force of the patient.
Allopathy suppresses the diseases with medicines and produces poisonous situation in the body.
The destruction of life force starts with the use of medicines.
The body continues to grow continuously for approximately upto 25 - 30 years.
The work of intelligence and construction is also finished in this period only.
Those men and women who destroy semen and menses in unnatural way , there is no production of glaze , fame , revolution , intelligence and strength.
Because of being extremely weak many dangerous diseases may be produced in men and women.
According to medical science one drop of semen is produced by 40 drops of blood.
According to Ayurveda one drop of semen is produced by 80 drops of blood.
According to yogashastra after semen discharge the death comes near and after it is digested in the body life is saved.

The use of anima can be done in all the diseases.
In order to remove foreign particles accumulated in the intestines and to increase the power of the intestines the use of anima is done.
For anima generally the quantity of water is from 500 m.l.To 1500 m.l.
This quantity of water is also dependent on the acceptance of the patient.
The quantity of water which the patient can retain in his intestine , only that much of water he should be allowed to take.
There are many methods of taking anima.
In one condition after lying flat and leaving the abdomen region loose both the knees are folded upwards.
In the second condition by lying on the left side the right leg should be folded from the knee.
The pot of anima should be kept three feet above the bench.
Fill warm water in the pot.

After this the stopper is opened , so that the water starts going inside.
While taking anima the stomach should gently be rubbed.
After the entire water has gone inside the tube is taken out and the stomach is rubbed from right to left.
Deep breaths should be taken while taking anima.
After taking anima one should lie down on the left and right or should take light walk , due to which the excreta gets dissolved in the water completely.
On going to the toilet while excreting the excreta should be allowed to come out on its own.
There is no need of taking special effort.
It is not essential that in one go the bowel gets cleared.

What is balanced diet ? 
Form food the only aim of man is not just to fill stomach , gain health or fulfil taste , but also to bring about mind , character and spiritual growth.
The interest of man towards various types of foods is the symbol of his conduct and recognition.
Therefore in food the consumption of those types of foods should be done which is helpful in physical , mental , principle , social and spiritual enhancement.
Balanced diet develops love , affection , friendship , forgiveness , tenderness , non violence peace etc properties.
Grow the feeling of respect and honor toward the humans.
Those foods in which there is no fulfillment of the above mentioned things and the consequences come the opposite instead , that food can not be called balanced.
What type is nutritive diet ? 
In the food the eleme  nts providing energy , strength and heat to the body like proteins , glucose , fat , minerals , vitamins etc should be present in proper ratio and sufficient quantity.
Due to which the growth of good cells in the body continues to take place.
According to one 's own financial ability , the selection of those substances may be done depending on the likeness and availabilty and personal necessity from the substances of various categories.
Nutritive substances are also present in vegetarian food materials.
Today many doctors and people consider consuming nonvegetarian food for protein and calorie due to misleading advertisements.
But in many vegetarian food materials also protein , calorie , vitamins and nutritive substances are available in sufficient quantity.
In nonvegetarian items the outer part of pulses , cereals etc there is no quantity of fiber present at all.
This has been ascertained by the scientists that fiber has a lot of importance in preventing diseases.
Vitamins are also essential for our health.
The source of these vitamins are vegetable substances only.
The main source of food for animals and humans is the food obtained by agriculture or plants.
The proteins which are found in meat , those also are obtained from plants alone.
Therefore getting nutrition directly from vegetable substances is better than from that secondary nutrition which in animal meat has also been obtained from vegetable substances.
Some people spread this rumor that egg is a complete nutrition.
Vitamin - C , carbohydrates and fiber are not found at all in eggs.
Egg , meat , fish etc are acidic food due to which there is removal of calcium from the bones and due to this type of loss occurring of calcium it takes longer for the bone to rejoin after fracture.
There is also more cholesterol in eggs.
Any type of toxic substance can not arise in balanced diet prepared by mixing fruits , green vegetables , various types of lentils , seeds and milk.
Its main reason is that when an animal dies then it becomes dead substance.
This does not apply to vegetables.
If any vegetable is cut even half and its half part is put inside the ground then it will grow again in the form of vegetable or tree.
This is possible only because vegetable is a living substance.
This thing can not be said for a lamb , goat or chicken.
From the other special sources it has been found this that when an animal is killed then it becomes afraid and the toxic substance released due to fear sprears in his body.
That same toxic substance reaches the body of those people in the form of meat who eat them.
Our body is not completely capable of excreting all those toxic substances.
The acid base balance is essential in food.
Many doctors believe that the reason of disease in body is the imbalance of acid-base.
It is such belief of doctors that in our body there are approximately 80 percent are basic substances and approximately 20 percent are acidic substances.
But in our food attention is not paid on the ratio of acid - base.
It is the belief that in the peels of maximum fruits and vegetables generally there is more basic substance and in the inner part there is acidic substance more.
Therefore the doctors advice to eat the edible substances without removing the peels.
But in the present times due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the consumption of cereals and vegetables without washing them properly and with peels may also become the reason of harm because of some part of poison remaining in them.
The aim of saying is this only that instead of giving importance to one sided thought with respect to food , we should take decision after thinking on every side with multiple point of view as per the weather and physical needs.
But in no case the natural doctrines of Nature should be ignored.
According to Chinese Panch Tatva doctrines various tastes have relations with different organs of the body.
Natural doctors have such beliefs that liver and pancreas are affected by sour taste.
Hot taste has relation with lungs and large intestine.
Sweet taste has direct relation with spleen and gall bladder.
The heart and small intestines etc are affected by bitter taste.
With these tastes not just our organs get affected but the nutrition of these organs also take place.
The doctors consider the balance of taste in foood alone as the base of health.
The doctors treat by balancing various tastes.
The food should be according to the weather.
Those food materials which are obtained maximum from the nature in that month , is generally considered to be good from the point of view of health.
Maximum birds - animals which do not accumulate food and lead a carefree life lead there life on the basis of available fruits , leaves alone.
The nature gives complete support in order to keep each person healthy.
All the animals eat only those things , which is available around them.
Animals do not import food materials from other places.
The laws of nature are equal for every one poor and rich.
Therefore the consumption of expensive , unseasonal , imported food material is always useful for health , is completely false.
Balanced diet itself does the work of medicine.
Such is the belief of dieticians that the relation of maximum physical diseases is due to food related ill habits , carelessness and inattentiveness.
The chief reason of this is our ignorance about right food , greed for taste , lack of timely thoughtfullness , lack of prudence , immoral conduct , selfish point of view etc.
In various medical methods attentiveness towards diet is an important part of treatment.
In natural treatment diet only is given the maximum importance for health and treatment.
According to the point of view of natural doctors and dieticians food alone is the medicine.

One special thing has been said about sugar is that from the point of view of vitamins it does not have any type of speciality.
Sugar is only a type of sweetness , no type of nutritive substance is obtained from it.
The heart is damaged by eating sugar.
In 1949 one Japanese doctor had researched on sugar.
As a result of the use of excess sugar the disease of hypoglucamia disease has spread in Europe and America.
In the patient suffering with hypoglucamia initially he feels physical weakness , then there is false hunger and then sweating.
The body of the patient at times starts shivering and he also becomes unconscious.
The doctors have said that for this disease sugar only is responsible.
Due to sugar there is also a type of indigestion and constipation.
After the arrival of sugar in stomach it produces a type of burning in stomach and intestines.
This happens due to the acid produced during the digestion of sugar.
The substances rich in sugar produce 20 % more acidity.

How should the food be in rough cold ? 
Wrong food becomes the reason of cold in at least nine out of ten people.
Generally people eat anything that comes in front.
People eat all types of things together.
The question of food is extremely important for the patient of cold.
Chew the food very well and eat gradually.
Abiding by it is essential both for the patient as well as healthy.
Cold occurs due to the consumption of wrong food.
Wrong food produces more than expected indigestion.
gas and acidity is produced by indigestion.
Later on poison is produced due to the rotting of food in the intestine.
Some portion of these undigested food gets absorbed by the blood because of which it becomes polluted and acidic.
That blood travels in all the parts of the body and makes each corner diseased.
When all the veins of blood and body become polluted then some or the other disease should definitely occur and often it gets manifested in the form of cold.
Be light eater in food.
Prepare the food very plain.
Eat fresh things sufficiently and abstain from pickle , jelly , chutney and canned food to the extent possible.

Those whose eye color has become bad they should not eat cream or paneer till the time its color becomes clear.
Eat some fresh fruits and raw vegetables daily and certainly.

Fruit and vegetable prevent the food from getting rotten in the intestine and this way also support in keeping the body disease free as well.
Meat or meat made food should not be eaten.

The labourer is physially tired , intellctuals are tired in mental way.
Working women have become tired due to bearing double responsibitlity.
In this fast paced world every one is tired.
One disease is the tiredness occuring without any reason.
Some person who does no do any physical and mental work leading to tiredness , then also every time tiredness keeps them surrounded.
When this feeling of tiredness enters you permanenly , then the problem becomes more complex.
According to psychologists , the condition of the reduction of interests and desires only is tiredness.
Which serially decreases and increases in proportion to interests and wishes.
In normal meaning the physical and mental tiiredness of man may be considered tiredness.
In scientific language this situation may be called called neursthania.
Among the mental disorders due to tiredness the names of worry , tension , boredom and inner conflict can be counted.
These things are common in the stressful life of the present world.
Those people who are not able to strike balance of the situations on the mental level , they finally become the victims of tiredness.
More than the relation which tiredness has with body , more than that it is related to your psychological state.
If you are suffering with disease like fatigue then you should introspect your entire life - style.
After finding the reasons of tensions honestly try to remove them.
For escaping from tiredness stay happy and cheerful always.

That wound is called peptic ulcer which is formed in the upper part of the small intestine deudenum , stomach or the lower part of the food pipe.
These are serially called deudenal ulcer , gastric ulcer and oesophageal ulcer.
Keep in mind , that it is not important that every patient having pain in the upper part of the stomach should have ulcer or acidity.

In these tests stool tests , endoscopy and borium x - ray are main.
If the patient is consuming smoke , alcohol , pan masala then quitting them is extremely essential.
To the extent possible escape from excessive mental tension and take rest as much as possible.
Eat food slowly after chewing it properly and the food to be eaten in two times should be taken four - five times.
Any such type of food because of which the pain and discomfort of the patient increases , do not take.

Do not consider this as sufficient but the complete healing of the food is also important , because of which the symptoms do not occur again.
For this take medication by staying in the vigilance of a good doctor.
Why and how should high blood pressure be controlled ? 
Today 's consumerism , tension and competitive life , wrong eating habits , lack of rest alone are the chief root of high blood pressure.
This decreases and increases day - night.
On the development of blood pressure once it can stay for the entire life without any difference.
In the world more than 60 crore people have been registered as the patients of high blood pressure.
Finally this is also considered as the reason of heart attacks.
Because of persisitent high blood pressure continuous damage reaches to brain , heart , kidneys , pancreas and reproductive organs.
Since it can not be felt continuously , but it can bring the damage which can not be corrected.
Because of maintained high blood pressure it can produce stroke in the brain.
Which is considered as the most dangerous situation.
Excessively increased blood pressure tears the weak vessels after damaging them.
Consequently there is localized bleeding.
It produces paralysis.
Similarly by increasing the pressure in blood vessels high blood pressure produces the stroke of heart.
Which creates permanent damage to the heart muscles because of which that portion becomes dead like and brings growth in the heart.
Because the above mentioned heart attack , after creating lack of oxygen in the quantity obtained through the blood to the muscles of the heart produces pain in the chest which is called enzyna.
If this resource of oxygen and blood becomes increasingly less then it would be called the stroke of heart.
When the blood pressure starts increasing then the resource of blood in the rest of the organs decreases because of the increased accumulation of blood in the heart.
The increased pressure within the heart damages the walls and the openings of the heart and produces tension.
The high blood pressure affects the activity of blood purification after contracting the blood vessels.
After its permanence the purification of blood becomes abnormal and becomes the reason of the infection of kidney and other disorders.
Since through the knidney the adverse substances for the body are removed daily post digestion through the urinary passage.
But due to abnormal activity these substances return to the body again and make the body poisonous and become the reason of kidney failure.
The increased pressure for long duration enhances the pressure in the blood vessel which take the blood to the retina and may even tear them.
Due to which the blood secretion occuring on the body may take away the eye - sight permanently.
With the increase of age the blood vessels lose the property of their flexibiity after becoming stiff.
These stiff vessels are called vessel stiffness.
Due to these very arteries the high blood pressure create more dangers and make the situation extremely serious and damages heart , brain , kidney.
Due this very difficulty of artery some it also weakens the feet.
For high blood pressure control consult the related doctor and get the tests done.
In high blood pressure test lipid frofa , blood urea , blood sugar , E.C.G.etc.are done.
After this as per the doctor advice are given as to which salt to use for food , what exercise to take , how to sleep etc..

If our weight is more than normal then we should decrease it immediately.
Do not take fried , salty or fatty food or take it minimally.
Do not eat stomach-full or again and again.
Drink more cold water this water receives additional energy from the body and increases its consumption.
Avoid non-vegetarian food and if you eat then along with it eat only fruit and green vegetable and salad three times more.
Do not take wine , tobacco , cold drinks and junk-food etc..
Use unpeeled grains and lentils.
One must walk 5 kms everyday with speed in morning or in the evening.

Learn the difference between cholestrol and fat.
Fat can alone increase your weight but cholestrol alone can not increae your weight.
In 9 out of 10 people the reason behind obesity is the presence of both the fat and the cholestrol.
When the cholestrol is in the body in normal quantity then it plays an important role in keeping the artries of the heart healthy.
It is very important for health that the cholestrol be in normal quantity.
It is produced in the liver of our body by the nature.
If there is too much cholestrol in the body then it leads to the disease ` Aeksklerosis '.
In the ` Aeksklerosis ' disease , a wax-like substance is secreted in the artries which makes them very narrow.
Due to this wax-like substance blood is not able to flow properly which leads to heart attack.
HDL cholestrol is a high density lipoprotein.
Its job is to clear the way of the blood flow such that the work of the heart mechanism goes on smoothly.
We can call HDL cholestrol the good cholestrol.
LDL cholestrol is a low density lipoprotein.
LDL cholestrol accumulates in the artries by combining with the fat which causes obstacle in the flow of the blood.
Due to the obstacle in the blood flow , there is a danger of heart disease.
We can call LDL cholestrol the bad cholestrol.
Vegetable fat is unsaturated lipid.
Because of vegetable ghee and the process of organic hydrogenation , vegetable oil takes the solid form in the room temperature.
Vegetable fat is not so harmful as saturated fat.
As far as obesity is concerned both kinds of fat increases obesity.
Animal fat the fat found in all kinds of meat and milk products comes under this category.
Animal fat is saturated fat , which means that it becomes solid from liquid at room temperature.It increases the fat cells of our body which leads to increase in the weight.
Animal fat , along with the bad cholestrol , reduces the blood flow towards the mind and the heart.
If you want to remain healthy then before having your food first see how much is the quantity of the cholestrol and the fat.
Endocrine glands have a very important place in our body.
When endocrine glands secrete in enough quantity then our helath remains perfect but in case of the opposite our health malfunctions hence it is compulsory for us to keep them healthy under any condition.
Because of these endocrine glands someone is found to be extremely small , some tall , some fat and some absolutely thin.
Eunuchs are also the result of the abnormality of these endocrine glands.
Sometimes you would have seen hairs on the face of the girls and boys without moustache and beards and would have heard of sex change all this is the result of the abnormality of the endocrine glands.
It is clear from all this that secretion of the endocrine glands keep a balance on our mental development , internal and external activities and behavior etc..
The hormone secreting from the pancreat gland is insulin.
Pancreat gland keeps a control over the quantity of insulin.
When the body has excessive glucose then the secretion of insulin converts into glucose and due to the lack of insulin diabetes occurs.
Thyroid glands are of the shape of the shield and they are situated in the throat on the both sides of the trachea.
The hormone secreted from thyroid glands is called thyroxin and it controls the growth of the body and the rate of the heart beat.
It is helpful in proper usage of carbohydrate.
In case of deficiency of glucose in the body the secretion of thyroxin helps in the formation of glucose by separating carbohydarte from other substances and controls the quantity of calcium.
In case of throxin becoming over-active phosphate along with calcium is lost from the bone and it begins to come in excretion and consequently the bones become thin and weak.
Parathroids are four in number and they are situated attached to the throid glands.
The hormone secrted in it helps in keeping the optimum quantity of calcium and phosphate in the blood.
Its deficiency lead to tetanus , calcium deficiency and increase in phosphorous.
The secretion of liver and stomach removes the deficiency of blood.
The secretion of liver and stomach increases the red blood cells in the blood.
Adrenal gland is also called suprarenal gland it is near the kidneys.
Every gland has two parts.
The outer part is called adrenal cortex and the inner part is called adrenal almedula.
The secretion of the outer part of the bordering kidney has a great importance.
The removal of outer part by operation causes immediate death.
The outer part is essential for life.
The sexual feelings are balanced by these hormones.
Due to more secretion than required untimely sexual development takes place.
For example periods and complete development of sexual organs in 2-4 years old girls.
Testes in the males and ovaries in the females are present in the form of sexual glands.
We call the juice secreted by these sex glands the sex hormone and it is this which gives maleness to the males and femaleness to the females.
Pituitary gland is the part of the brain itself and it is very small in size.
Several types of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland.
It is because of these hormones that the hormones secreted by the rest of the glands is produced in the right qunatity and their work is completely controlled.
It is very necessary for the normal development.
When these hormones do n't work properly then even the giant-sized children could also be born.
These hormones are very helpful in removing the dwarfism.
The elements that develops then is produced in the front part of the pituitary gland.
The secretion of these glands is chemical and their work is also to produce chemical effect.
Taking bath in cold water leads to the formation and the secretion of hormones within the body on time and in proper form.
When these glands get live food then they do their work properly.
Use of fresh pure cold water is helpful in their secretion.
Therefore in order to improve the chemical work of these glands , we should take the complete chemical elements obtained by unripe food whether you take it in the form of water by taking the juice or just the unripe food in itself.
Because of the use of cold water the glands secrete properly by becoming strong and fired up.
The property of unripe food is also cold and that of acidic ripe potato hot.
Therefore unripe food is necessary for the proper development and secretion of these glands.
Besides these endocrine glands , dineal gland and thymous gland also have an important place.
Sufficient secretion by Pineal gland leads to proper secretion and development of sexual glands and it is also helpful in the mental development.
Because of the proper secretion of thymous gland , sexual maturity comes on time.
It is necessary to know about the deficiency signs of the endocrine glands so that the related glands could be fired up.
When absorption and release process of carbohydrate could not take place completely due to the deficiency of insulin then diabetes occurs.
In case of deficiency of thyroxin , along with obesity and goitre , the absorption of iron could not take place sufficently.
In case of deficiency of secretion by the sexual gland , there is a lack of maleness and femaleness.
In case of deficiency of secretion by pituitary gland , alongwith dwarfism , strength also diminishes and complete inaction could even lead to death.
In case of deficiency of secretion by pineal gland , there is an untimely development of sexual maturity and there is an improper mental development.
In case of deficiency of secretion by thymous gland the development of sexual organs is not proper and complete.
In case of deficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland , the life force diminishes and in complete inaction could even lead to death.
In this way the proper understanding of the indications caused by the deficiency of secretion is very helpful in removing the deficiency.
Cytica is a disease of nerves.
In the inner portion of the body , cytica nerve is a long nerve in comparison to the others.
Coming out of the lower end of the spine , it has gone towards the leg from behind the ankles.
The pain which it causes is called cytica.
This pain originates at the back and sometimes spread till the toe of the leg.
But generally the pain is caused by the part of this very nerve.
It is always limited at the back side.
The pain of cytica is very painful and it can be compared to the pain of the toothache.
This disease generally remains from several weeks to several months and in difficult circumstamces it can carry on till several years.
Cytica occurs due to cold , residence in damp place , paralysis of the muscles and constipation etc..
When due to these reasons the blood flow becomes poisonous and the cytica nerve becomes agitated by this poison and swelling appears in it then this disease appears.
Therefore in many areas cytica is called a kind of neuritis.
Sometimes as a result of an injury to the lower portion of the spine the cytic nerve is affected causing this disease.
It is said that this condition arises by standing or walking for a long time , bending suddendly , picking up heavy weight etc..
In cytica disease it is extremely important to make the patient healthy along with the local treatment.
For this it is specially important to pay attention towards the methodology.
But now because of the emergence of different diseases and allergies by the use of artificial resources , people have begun to give importance to the natural alternative.
It is necessary to give special attention towards the formation of acid-accumulation in the patient 's body.
In many situations this disease appears bcause of the decrease in acid.
If one can fast one day before the treatment then the patient is sufficiently benefitted.
In all the old diseases one should fast in some form.
The body gets cleansed by fasting.
Other dietary methods are similar to mental weakness.
How natural are the beauty products ?.
Nature is not just the beauty source but also a big source of beauty products.
We get such natural things from it which increases the beauty of our skin and hair as well as eliminates their diseases.
Our body has the wonderful capacity to absorb the beneficial effects of these herbs.
Their speciality is that they do n't have any negative or harmful effects on the body.

They along with keeping the skin clean also nourishes them.
It increase the blood flow and brings glow to the skin.
It also makes the skin free of diseases.
Today beauty products made of artificial chemicals in the form of beauty materials is quite popular.

But due to the emergence of different diseases and allergies people have now begun to give importance to the natural alternative.
A lot of beauty products are now being sold in the market in the name of ` natural '.
Are they really natural ?.
Generally this question is a mystery for the consumers.
If we take a look at the advertisements then it is so that in the name of ` natural ' and ` herbal ' mostly chemical products are being sold.
Generally instead of taking the ready made herbal or natural beauty products available in the market if we prepare it in the home in consultation with a qualified herbal specialist then it is better.
Although in the busy life this is definitely a little difficult for every woman or man yet it is the best.
Some dependable herbal beauty products could be used.

She says that the way there is a reaction on the skin by the use of artifical products , in the same way there could be a harmful reaction from the products made up of herbs.
So the guarnatee of the color and oneness of the products in every batch can not be given.
But there is no reduction in the effectiveness of the products because of our dependence on the nature.
It is also good to forget.
In the lives of all of us there are many moments worth forgetting.
It would have happened with you that some name might have been there in your mind but that does not come to your tongue.
Sometime you forget after keeping the keys somewhere.
It is believed by the zoologists that even behind this incomplete memory of the humans also there is a motive.
Some people are unwavering in their belief that if we want a permanent impression of knowledge then it is necessary that our memory be incomplete.
If we could remember everything at the conscious level then we would go crazy.
Everything would have gone awry by the memory of smaller events , therefore it is good that we remember only the important things.
Healthy mind exists in a healthy body.
If your age is more than forty years and exercise four or five times a week then surely you could beat in memory that person of your age who do n't exercise.
If you do n't exercise regularly then leave your laziness now.
The wonderful tonic for the mind is the exercise.
It improves the flow of blood to the brain.
Our memory increases automatically.
Solving crosswords , puzzles and playing games like chess and cards sharpens your memory.
These games benefit slowly and at micro level now it depends on you which game you like.
Write all the things to remember briefly on a piece of paper.
This way this information will go into your memory.
With this your mind becomes free to memorise other things.
The storage of your memory is limited.
It will not be pressurized a lot if the list is made.
Whatever happens is not completely independent from the other events.
Pay attention to these events.
Very easily the description of any particular event will begin to flash in the mind.
If the mind does not co-operate , even then such facts could be searched in any book of general knowledge.
By combining the events sequentially in this way many times our mind begins to think in the right direction.

There is production of kulanj by getting much drenched in rain , swimming and bathing excessively in lake and rivers.
Gas getting aggravated by much cold makes faeces dry and hard , then expulsion of faeces does not become possible.
In such a case faeces starts decomposing in intestines and occurrence of pain of kulanj arises.
By eating and drinking coarse and condensed things when there is production of much cough in body then cough also starts accumulating in intestines.
Because of all these gas produces constipation by drying faeces.

Stool becomes harder on constipation staying for many days.
Anus is there on the edge of the large intestine.
There are three bands formed inside the large intestine at a difference of one and a half fingers that assist in expelling stool out of anus.
Swelling arises inside anus by decomposition of stool.
First tiny rashes erupt in anus.
Because of swelling in anus rashes fester.
When we apply pressure to expel faeces then hard stool scores those rashes and makes it bleed.

In badi bawasir warts outside anus are absent.
Warts are not inside the anus either but there is a lot of distress like khooni bawasir.
The outburst of gas occurs again and again in badi bawasir.
Getting infected gas moves around fast in stomach.
On occurrence of a strong outburst of gas it also moves around in parts of body.

The life cycle of one wave is very small , so there is a big difference between two waves.
During this time the probe catches the sound waves sent back by the body.
The knowledge of any kind of problem in the body is known by the duration that sound takes in going to that part and coming back and the study of the picture formed on the screen.
Basically it is very difficult to understand the behavior of the sound and for that a computer is needed.

The quantiy of medicine in the blood of the infant.
In what stage of pregnancy the medicine is used.
The medicine used by the mother can produce deformities in the child by two ways.
One because of its own ill-effect.
Second because of the formation of some extra material during metabolism for example , thaelidomaid produces monocarboxilic acid in the body of the child , which produces deformity in the child.
During pregnancy , vitamins other than Vitamin A and Vitamin D can be used.
Due to the excess of Vitamin A , the kidneys and nervous system of the child can become affected.
Similarly the excess of Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium in the blood mother and the child , which can cause ` Hypa Calcimia ' in the child.
The use of pain-killer analgesic aspirin can reduce the amount of prost glandils in the body , which could lead to an increased time period of both the pregnancy and the gestation period.
However aspirin is used in small quantity during the pregnancy to control the high blood pressure , adverse effects of the child etc.
If it is used in a large quantiy then it can have adverse effects.

The protective shield gives protection to the person from all kinds of negative waves.
These negative waves could be because of any reason like because of envy or prejudice of some other person.
These negative waves sometimes pervade the environment around us.
Hospital , crematorium or graveyard are the principal places of the negative waves.
The protective shield also stops our positive waves from getting wasted.
This shield is also necessary for our daily life , especially in the places like office or work-place , market-place , crowded place , railway station , hotel etc.
The protective shiled is made by the violet color.
You imagine two boxes of rectangular shaped mirrors of violet color.
One small box in which you are completely enclosed and the other box in which the first box is enclosed.
The surface of the mirror is completely safe no negative energy could break it.

Generally questions about right food is being asked in the Reiki seminar.
The question which is asked most prominently is Do non-vegetarian food and intoxication affects the natural flow of Reiki ?.
There is no kind of condition with Reiki , but even we are here shedding light on the non-vegetarian food and intoxication.
It is extremely important that you do n't keep any kind of guilt-feeling in your mind.
Because guilt-feeling comes in your mind only when you do n't want to do that work but you do.
Reiki is that energy which develops and establishes your harmony with the nature.
After the initiation of Reiki humans will himself be able to decide what is in his favor , what kind of food habits he has to keep.
Reiki is independent of the effects of views and your food habits but they have a explicit or implicit effect on yor health.
The effectiveness of Reiki is also affected.
The effectiveness of Reiki depends on your health.
In such a situation person will be able to use Reiki only for one 's own health , will not be able to help anyone else.
Because how can an ill body help someone else.
On the basis of life-energy there is no difference in the body of humans and animals.
The principal elements of life-energy are air , sun , water and earth.
Our body becomes ill by the imbalance of these basic elements itself.
This life-force is comletely balanced in the plants and trees.
This life-force could taken visibly in the form of food.
Plants , vegetables and cereals are the natural reserves of these forces.
This life-force reserve remains present in them for quite a long time , even after they are cooked.
This way when the person eats vegetables , etc , pulses and cereals then he takes in the visibly available life-force present in them.
That is why it is living food.
Besides this when we are in a condition of fear , anxiety , conflict , prejudice then bio-chemical changes happen in our body which spreads in our body in the form of poison.
This poison affects our body with different kinds of diseases.
Similarly when a person kills an animal for food then at that time that animal is overpowered by fear and bio-chemical changes happen in his whole body very quickly.
This poison in the form of chemical spreads in his whole body.
This chemical , because of fear , shock and pain is produced in larger quantity.
The person who eats this meat eats this poison as well and takes the negative force in the visible form along with.
This force in future slowly begins to show its negative impact on the body and the person becomes affected with many diseases.
The consciousness present in the plants is completely different from the consciousness found in the animals.
The life force which is necessary for the food of humans that humans get in visible form in vegetables , cereals and pulses.
Intoxication first of all affects the mind and inspires the emotions buried into the unconscious mind to come out.
The buried emotions could be also of love , could be also of hate.
The person begins to behave abnormally due to intoxication because he no longer has control over his mind.
The person can even become violent because of intoxication.
The consequences for the persons who indulge in intoxication is generally serious.
Intoxication always ends in mental depression itself.
The effect of intoxication is always negative on the body.
Slowly the important parts of body goes on becoming inoperable.
The main element of solar plexus is fire and liquor which itself is a fire element completely destroys the solar plexus.
Along with heart chakra closes by shrivelling which in itself is a fearsome situation.
Whether intoxication is of liquor or some other intoxicant material , the result is of simialr kind.
Similarly the intoxication of cigarrette , biri is also of the same kind , whose consequences are not good.
Slowly solar plexus begins to shrivel which gives rise to many stomach related problems.
The smoke coming out of cigarrette slowly keeps on obstructing the aura.
The smoke coming out of biri stops the pure and fresh life force coming from outside and slowly all the chakra keeps on getting affected.
Therefore for good health and being a good Reiki channel it is best to keep away from the intoxication.
The person should take oath to leave the intoxication which will be an indication of good will power.
Sugar , sweets , chocolate , bottled  packeted drinking material are prepared by different chemicals.
These edible materials prepared by different kinds of chemicals is dangerous for our health.
There is no nutrition in these edible materials at all.
In the race for modernity the level of knowledge has come so low that people have made these products an inseparable part of their life.
Sugar is a kind of acid because it is prepared with the help of acid itself.
This acid produces many kinds of diseases in our body.
Among which the principal ones are ulcer , arthritis , problems of kidney , skin disease , insomnia and disinterest towards the study of children etc.
Those people who have mental depression and epilepsy they should shun sugar and products made up of sugar.
Similarly chocolate harms the children the most.
There are twenty spoonful of sugar in one square of chocolate.
In the same way are the packaged food items , they also give only diseases to us.
A kind of chemical MSG-Monosodium or aginomoto is mixed in the packaged food which has the capacity to keep the food for more days.
The packaged food gives invitation to many diseases.
This chemical affects our nervous system the most which stops the mental development of children , headache , mental depression and pain in the neck are there.
Although in the west people have almost shunned milk , but in India milk has remained the synonym for good health.
Therefore any argument against it would not be acceptable to the common man.
Even though it is important to tell in its relation that the milk of animal is meant for the animals.
A child can drink one 's mother 's milk till the age of three years.
Because till the age of three years those chemicals rennin and lactose are there in the child 's body which could digest the milk.
That is it dissolves the element Casein that is found in the milk.
But after the age of three years these chemicals rennin and lactose end automatically and then the element casein found in the milk is not able to get digested and slowly keeps on accumulating in the intestine.
In order to clean up this material mucous is created in large quantity and slowly it gives rise to many diseases.
If you are suffering from diseases like tonsil , bronchitis then immediately stop the milk.
In reality the calcium found in the milk is itself the main reason behind many diseases.
The large quantity of phosphorous in milk forces the blood to extract calcium from the healthy bones and teeth of the body.
The calcium found in the milk produces an excess of calcium in the blood which creates tumor , cataract , stone in the kidneys and gall bladder.
The calcium found in the milk gives rise to common diseases like problems of bones , spondilitis , sciatica , etc.
Cough and cold , sinusaitis , epistaxis and hay fever etc are among the major disease of nose ... ....
Cough and cold occurs by the bacteria which is always present in upper respiratory tract.
When the body is healthy then these bacteria remains weak but as soon as the strength of body diminishes because of cold etc or in those people whose immune power has decreased then the bacteria becomes empowered.
There are many symptoms of cough and cold like shivering of the body , sneezing , blowing from the nose , flow of water from eyes , pain in the throat and excessive thirst.
There could also be slight fever in the cough and cold.
As the disease of cough and cold becomes old then besides head , nose and throat the diseases of chest could also appear like acute bronchitis , asthama and pneumonia etc.
In case of increased sinus there is also pain in the teeth of the upper jaws.
In case of increased sinus swelling appears near the eyes.
The swelling of nasal cavity is called sinusitis.
By giving Reiki at the indicated places sinus is treated forever.
If because of some irresponsible acts its effects appear then give Reiki to the following centres many times a day , the disease will end in one day itself.
Pituitary gland , heart chakra , solar plexus and liver and besides this lungs etc are its center.
Give the elements with Vitamin C or its tablets in large quantity to the patients of sinusitis and cough and cold.
The raltion of hay fever is with head , nose , eyes and respiratory tract.
hay fever is mainly the disease of allergy in which the inner membrane of the nose swells due to which the patients finds difficulty in breathing.
Flow of water from nose , tears after eyes getting wet , heaviness of head and continuous sneezing are main symptoms of hay fever.
Because of hay fever many people are not able to sleep properly and they begin to suffer from diarrohea.
By giving Reiki at the centres of cough and cold this disease is cured.
The major among the diseases of throat are tonsil , adenoids and goitre etc.
In the mouth at the beginning of the throat where there is oesophagus and wind pipe , there are two glands there.
These glands are called tonsils.
Similar glands situated towards the upper portion of throat in the way of wind pipe are called adenoids or pharyngeal tonsils.
Tonsil has a very important role in keeping the body disease-free.
As soon as the germs try to enter into the body through the way of mouth , tonsil terminates them.
In this way tonsil protects the body from many diseases.
Tonsil is also helpful in the formation of the white blood cells.
In the condition of infection it becomes bigger in size and hard.
In the condition of infection first it becomes deep red in color and then later pus begins to come out.
When tonsil swells a lot then an extreme pain begins in the throat.
Lots of problems begin to occur in swallowing the edible objects , sometime there is cough and fever also , swellings occur in the throat.
Generally this disease increases while sleeping , one feels the thirst again and again.
Because of the swelling of tonsil there is also pain in the throat and there is problem in hearing.
The disease of tonsil is called tonsilitis.
Tonsilitis generally occurs in the children and teenagers.
It generally happens by cold , abnormality in milk , ice , icecream , the fried materials and ringworm etc.
Adenoids are some extended pieces of flesh exactly at the back of the nose , connected to the membrane of the naso-pharunx.
When adenoids increase then there is lot of pain.
Adenoid disease is also genrally found in the children.
goitre is the disease of knot formation and swelling in the throat.
goitre mainly occurs because of the deficiency of iodine.
There is a very serious effect on the thyroid gland because of the deficiency of iodine.
In order to remove the deficiency of iodine one should use iodised salt.
Soyabean oil and the soyabean products are harmful in adenoid disease.
By continuously giving Reiki at these centres for several days the above mentioned diseases could be cured.
Ajna chakra , throat chakra , soalr plexus , thyroid , spleen and root chakra are the principal ones.
In the last few years there is a lot of increase in the problem of cervical spondilitis.
In cervical spondilitis there is little to extreme pain in the neck.
Some swelling occurs on the lower back side of the neck of many people.
Neck of many does not turn at all or turns a little.
Similarly the patients of slipped prolapsed disc is also increasing everyday.
Mainly people think that the disc has come out by getting shaken.
When because of excessive work or some other reason there is no full natural expansion , no speed or rupture happens in the disc then pressure begins to fall on the nerves.
The capaciy of the spinal cord in the advancing age , picking up weight more than the strength or picking up in wrong way leads to slipped prolapsed disc.
In order to remove pain like this the patient should take the food full of vitamin-c or its tablets.
The patient should drink excess water and along with it by giving Reiki for long time at the following centres of the body this disease is cured.
Solar plexus , spleen , spinal cord , back solar plexus , throat chakra , back throat , root chakra and the local center where there is pain.
The pain of sciatica is highly unbearable.
There are mainy reasons behind sciatica pain like - the distorted construction of the lumber region of the spinal cord , appearance of some abnormality in this part of the cord.
Arthritis , any kind of boil , swelling or lump near the spinal cord , swelling in any part of spinal cord especially the bones of lumber region , swelling in the bone of the buttocks or any part of the lower portion of stomach etc can be the symptoms of sciatica.
Sciatica disease can also occur because of any problem in colon and old dyssentry.
If there is swelling or jerk in any part of body , which is related to the ....nerve then the pain in sciatica begins.
If the kidneys do not perform properly and there is excess formation of uric acid then also pain in Sciatica begins.
In sciatica pain from a normal pain to unbearable pain can begin at the lower protion of the back and reach till the feet through buttocks or leg.
This pain is generally felt in one leg and that too generally one the outer side of the leg.
Normally this pain occurs in cold weather and in the right leg.
It happens so because the muscles shrimp somewhat because of the cold.
In order to cure.disease give Reiki to lumber , sacrum , kidneys and urine bag , sacral chakra , root chakra , back solar plexus and the local centres everyday for almost half an hour for several days.
In addition to this give Reiki to liver , spinal cord and heart chakra.
The paitient of sciatica should drink excessive water.
Heart is a body part made up of elastic muscles extremely delicate , like a red-coloured bag , with four fragments.
Heart is situated in between both the lungs , towards the left of the chest in between the third to the sixth rib.
Heart is the main axis of human 's life.
There are many diseases of the heart.
Those diseases which are related to the structure of the heart and its internal abnormalities they are called organic disorders.
The major diseases among the heart and blood circulation diseases are high blood pressure , low blood pressure , valvular disorders , heart ... ....disease , arterio sclirosis , hardening of blood vessles etc.
The disease of high blood pressure does not come all of a sudden.
It comes slowly after giving premonitions of several kinds.
If high blood pressure is not treated on time then heart attack , disease of kidneys , paralysis and many diseases of eyes may occur.
In low blood pressure restlessness , weakness and tiredness , headache , cold sweat etc are the symptoms.
In low blood pressure do n't let there be deficiency of salt in the patient 's body.
Angina Pectoris occurs because of high blood pressure.
When sufficient quantity of oxygen is not able to reach heart because of contraction of artries and the heart has to exert more pressure for carrying out its normal work then angina disease occurs.
Angina disease increases because of ciggarette.
Never give Reiki on the front heart chakra of heart patient.
In case of emergency when there is a heart attack then immediately give Reiki on the back heart chakra.
Along with this make your posture on the left hand of the patient and press the front of his fingers and thumb with all your strength , heart attck will stop immediately.
I have used this method several times in very serious circumstances and got success.
In ... ... ....posture press the front part of both the middle and ring finger and thumb after bringing them together.
Forefinger and little the one near the small finger the smallest finger will remain straight.
The information about diabetes is there in China , Greece and India since ancient times itself from where it reached other countries.
The quantiy of urine in the situation of diabetes increases from three times to twelve-thirteen times of that of normal situation.
In diabetes the weight of many patients decrease a lot.
The skin begins to become dry and as the weight loss begins , it begins to shrivel also.
In diabetes a painful disorder occurs in the arteries of legs because of which pain , numbness and itching etc disease occurs.
The diabetes patients should give special attention towards their diet.
The patients should not take calories more than requirement.
The diabetes patient doing ordinary work need about 1500 to 2000 calories in a day.
Pregnant women and young children need little more calories than this.
The seeds of fenugreek are also very effective in diabetes.
National Institution of Nutrition , Hyderabad has researched that the seeds of fenugreek are panacea for the diabetes patients.
By eating 25 to 100 gm fenugreek mixed in curry or soup or else chappati diabtes can be controlled.
From among the objects told above use only one or two objects at one time.
It is not right to eat all the objects at once.
Besides this give Reiki to centres like pancreas , ajna chakra , solar plexus back and front , thyroid gland , live , kidneys and hara chakra etc the disease will be soon cured.
By treatment with above Reiki miraculous results have come to the fore and diabetes have been cured soon.
The most painful aspect of the joints and bones diseases is that in the condition of the increase in disease deformity appears in many body parts.
Due to the occurrence of deformity in the joints and bones the patients are not able to walk and neither are they able to do any work with ease.
One doctor from America had written in his book that man has reached on the moon but he does not have any cure for joint inflammation.
One should go to the nature itself for the treatment of this disease.
Reiki is the best solution for the joints and bones diseases.
In order to give motion to the body there are several joints of bones which are called joints.
Except skull , all other bones of the body are mobile.
Arthritis is the disease related to these very joint of bones.
Ligaments do the job of keeping these bones connected among themselves.
Besides these some fluid materials continuously keep the surface of the bones lubricated due to which the speed of the joints remain natural and easy and while moving they do not have any kind of pain.
There are sacs of liquid material near many joints which is called bursae.
In the joint inflammation diseases in addition to the swelling of joints there is an increase in the temperature of the body.
Muscles , tendons and nerves are also affected.
In this disease the blood vessels related to synovial membrane becomes flat from normal shape.
These blood vessels get more supply of blood than earlier due to which protein present in the blood and some other fluid material get accumulated around the joints through the blood vessels.
Due to this swelling occurs in the joints.
When the blood vessels collide with the joints then there is pain.
Those people who take more than 12 to 18 hours in the digestion they have a greater possibilty of contracting this disease.
In addition to this those people in whose blood there is a large quantity of acid and calcium materials arthritis disease is seen in them also.
Those people who take excessive wine and beer and take a lot of nutritious food and do not exercise , their liver and kidneys are not able to work properly , they contract arthritis disease.
In many people arthritis disease is paternal also.
Rheumatoid arthritis is seen three times in women in comparison to men.
Many doctors opine that rheumatoid arthritis especially affects the people living in colder places.
Small viruses could also become the reason behind rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis disease generally starts slowly.
In the beginning rheumatoid arthritis disease attacks the hannds and the legs.
Sometime in rheumatoid arthritis there is pain only in the knees.
According to the symptoms while waking up in the morning there is greater stiffness in the body parts and as the afternoon comes in , pain and stiffness decreases.
Slowly this disease reaches the fingers of hands and legs , elbows , arms , hips , knees and ankles.
In rheumatoid arthritis the fingers and hands and legs begin to become curved and stiff.
If this disease is not treated properly then heart and lungs could also be adversely affected.
Osteoarthritis generally this disease affects the people of middle age.
The symptoms of osteoarthritis is specially seen in the women.
Those women in whom this disease is seen more their menstruation ceases completely.
Osteoarthritis disease genrally affects fat people.
In osteoarthritis those joints are affected more on which the weight of the body falls i.e.spinal cord , kness and hips.
Gout generally this disease affects men.
Gout disease genrally affects the men above the age of 40 years.
In women this disease is very rarely seen.
Doctors are of the view that when some special protein elements purinis is not able to digest properly then this element is transformed into uric acid.
The crystals of uric acid begin to accumulate specially in joints and kidneys and skin.
The crystals of uric acid sharp and stinging like needles.
Gout starts suddenly.
In 90 % people gout starts from the joint of the thumb of the first leg.
According to the dosctors vitamin-c is an extremely miraculous medicine.
Along with it the patient should drink water in greater quantity and should eat fresh and green vegetables.
Along with it the patient is benefitted moraculously by doing Reiki and with continuous treatment gout is treated completely.
While doing Reiki the patient will feel that the disease is completely cured after three-four days , but after that he will feel it again but after this the disease will be cured slowly.
In this disease Reiki is to be given at the whole body.
Reiki should be given for longer time on centres like solar plexus , liver , spleen , ajna chakra , throat chakra etc.
The importance of ajna chakra is maximum from among the different chakras situated in our body.
Ajna chakra is situated in the middle of our head i.e.in the middle of both the eyebrows.
It is also referred to as the third eye of Shiva.
This story is famous in the Puranas.
It is by opening this third eye Lord Shankar had produced the Agni Tejas and with that the disturbing Kamdeva was burnt into ashes.
Damyanti had protected her modesty from the tiger by producing the magnanimous fire flame from the third eye.
From both these stories it is concluded that ajna chara is extremely important for us.
Sanjay had been able to get divine vision only by the development of the third eye.
As a result of the third eye Sanjay had begun to see all the scenes of Mahabharta war as in a television.
In the eyes of some people a special kind of attraction is found.
Special electronic waves flow through their eyes ... ... ... ....
This elctronic wave affects in both good and bad ways.
The incident of catching bad eye is common , this idea seems like superstition but there is a scientific fact in this idea and the reason behind this is this very electronic wave.
These electronic waves have a great impact on our life.
In the defensive look of eyes both good and bad kinds of elements are included whose effect could be used in the desired direction.
These electronic waves could be sharpened even more by Reiki.
I was becoming weaker day by day.
Doctor told me that there is infection in my lungs.
I did not panic as I had already learned Reiki.
I did not take any medicine , only did Reiki.
In about 21 days I had become completely healthy.
Generally husband - wife consider pregnancy a chance incident while it is not completely true.
There is a necessity to spread a worldwide awareness about the safe time for pregnancy.
In the absence of this awareness one third children and two lacs mothers become the victim of death every year.
It could be stopped if we know the safe time for pregnancy and instead of considering it a chance incident , we know that pregnancy occurs only according to the wishes of the husband - wife.
What is maternal death ? 
In pregnancy , if during child - birth or within six weeks of child - birth , if the woman dies , then it is called maternal death.
It is definite that if the information regarding safe pregnancy and contraception techniques could reach the people then maternal mortality rate could be brought down heavily.
Mother could also be freed of different kinds of diseases.
The meaning of lowering of mortality rate is the preservation of family , healthy nutrition and happiness in the society.
The duration of procreation life of any woman is from the age of thirteen years to forty five years.
But any woman is not always suitable for procreation.
The best period for pregnancy is from twenty to thirty years of age.
In this scientific age the medical science has developed so much that we have begin to understand the importance of the health of the child being brought up in the womb.
The age of procreation capability of a woman is generally accepted as 15 - 45 years.
The first five years and the last ten years of the procreation capability of women ' s life is full of risk.
If the common man could understand the terrible consequences of these 15 years of procreation then the long duration of procreation would come down to 15 years from 30 years.
That means from the age of 20 years to 35 years.
This will automatically give strength to the family planning program.
Most of the have this illusion that the sex of the child depends on the mother , which is wrong.
The ovum of the woman has only one kind of chromosomes xx.
The seeds of man sperm have two types of chromosomes xy.
By the fusion of one x of woman and one x chromosome of man a daughter xx and by the fusion of one x of woman and one y of woman a son xy is born.
Thus birth of son or daughter depends on their father and not on their mother.
Now a days the services related to the tests during pregnancy in the antenatal of hospitals and before pregnancy and marriage-related advice in the pregnancy clinics have been started.
There should be a difference of at least three years between two children.
The health of mother could also become suitable for the second child , not before this.
In young age i.e.at the age of less than 18 to 20 years if there is abortion then many complexities increase.
That is why it is said that before becoming pregnant it is necessary that a girl becomes a complete woman.
Because of the pregnancy in young age girls become physically and mentally weak.
In young age the girls are not so mature as to handle all the responsibilities of a mother.
In them incidents of spontaneous abortion and termination of pregnancy happen more.
Due to abortion the dangers related to it are also there , like anemia , infection , excessive blood-loss etc.
Along with pregnancy in the young age increase in blood pressure and loss of blood from body and presence of protein in urine are also found.
Because of pregnancy in young age deficiency in blood occurs and child birth is also painful.
During child birth the natural pain , meaning labor pain is not proper.
Because of improper development of the hip bone and the womb there is a need for surgery.
Because of pregnancy in young age often the child is born prematurely.
The child remains ill because of incomplete development.
Sometimes because of the pregnancy in young age the child even dies.
After the pregnancy in young age the infants are mostly very weak and their mortality rate is also greater.
After the pregnancy in young age often the mother becomes a victim of mental diseases.
Sometimes the stress increases to such level that mother commits suicide.
Bing a mother in advanced age meaning after 30-35 years of age is also extremely dangerous.
The maximum fertility strength of a woman is in the age of 23 years which slowly decreases.
In the age of forty years there is very little pregnancy.
In advanced age the chances of abortion also increase by pregnancy.
In advanced age blood pressure increases and the chances of heart disease increases with pregnancy.
In advanced age the effect of blood impurity increases during conception to pregnancy.
In advanced age there is a greater chance of vomiting because of pregnancy or blood loss during pregnancy.
In advancing age often excrescence forms in the womb.
This excrescence produces pain during pregnancy and causes obstacles during child birth.
Due to which child birth is done through surgery and not naturally.
The labor pain starts before the scheduled time and the birth of child also takes place before scheduled time.
With the advancing age there is an effect on the elasticity of the joints also and many time times placenta is also retained.
With the increase in the need for more surgery the danger for surgeons could also increase.
In the children born in advanced age there is an expansion of the innate defects.
Most of the children are born with innate physical defects like organ-fractures or limb disorder.
The innate physical defects of the children are also called ' Mangol Triguna Sutrata '.
With advancing age sometimes the child dies in the womb itself.
The incident of still born is thrice more in the middle ages pregnancy.
Dangers are not only in the pregnancy during young age or advanced age rather excessive pregnancy meaning if there are four or more children then there is a great increase in the mortality rate.
Many types of danger also arise because of excessive pregnancy.
During pregnancy development of the child takes place in the womb of the mother itself.
The elements which are required for the formation of human body , the child is dependent on the body of the mother for all that.
It could be easily understood that during pregnancy there is a deficiency of many important elements in the mother 's body.
Among these the main elements are iron , calcium and protein.
During the period of breast feeding the child also the mother 's need of calcium and protein is almost double of the normal.
Deficiency of blood could also be lethal.
The woman does not get opportunity to give complete meal to her body and make it healthy.
Because of deficiency in hemoglobin percentage deficiency of calcium occurs in the body.
As a consequence of the deficiency of calcium occurrence of ostomellisia is possible.
During pregnancy , during child birth or after child birth excess blood loss.
There is also the danger of bursting of womb because of the deficiency of nutritious elements.
In womb there are more incidents of twin children and placenta process.

Because of the deficiency of protein in women the immunity of the body decreases.
Because of the low immunity the mother easily becomes a victim of other diseases.
The mother could be mentally satisfied and happy only when she is physically healthy.
Mother 's happiness has a deep impact on the mental health of the child.
Mother becomes weak because of frequent pregnancy , neither is she able to carry the extra burden of child fostering nor can she remain happy.
If the difference between two children is not of two years then the probability of the death of the child increases by fifty per cent.
The information of some mothers regarding pregnancy is either incomplete or is based on some superstitions.
The mothers who are victim of the superstitions believe that till the first child is breast feeding she could not become pregnant.
In reality becoming pregnant and breast feeding the child there is no scientific relation between these two.
The mobile health centres may contact the mothers in the villages , show them some such documentary films which could remove their ignorance.
Some couple do not use the contraceptive techniques of family planning.
These outer means seem to be like obstacle in the way of the pleasure at that moment.
Such couples are kindly requested to go to the nearest health center and get complete information in this regard.
So that the marital bliss is also maintained and they could also get information regarding the right time of pregnancy.
Now that time has come when scientific development has eased a lot of problems but for this the couple should take advice from their doctor without any hesitation.
It is mostly seen that little educated people out of shame neither tell the whole thing to the doctor nor they are able to ask anything.
But there is nothing bad in getting complete information , even if that is related to the right time of pregnancy.
You should also have the information related to the infant.
There is bad effect on the child in the womb in case of pregnancy on an inappropriate time.
The weight of the child born fully mature is 2,500 gram.
For the child to develop completely it is necessary to remain in the womb of the mother for 37 weeks.
If the weight of the infant is less or is born before the 37 weeks then he will be weak and there will always be a fear of his being ill.
Those children whose weight is less than 2,500 gram and length less than 44 c.m.at the time of birth their parts of head and stomach are relatively big.
If there is incomplete development of bones , then its effect is also there on the internal organs of the body.
Lot of times lungs are not able to expand completely because of incomplete development of the respiratory system and the weakness of their muscles , consequently they have a deficiency of oxygen.
There is a bad effect on the development of the body because of the deficiency of oxygen.
As a result of this these children remain quite close to diseases or death.
Following diseases are frequently found in such types of children like asthma , breathing problem , secretion of blood in the brain , unconsciousness , the disease of jaundice etc.
There is a probability of getting relief from all these diseases and problems by pregnancy at the right time.
After the birth of a healthy child there is less difficulty in his nurturing and there is also great gain in his physical and mental development.
Good health is the base of all happiness.
Who is healthy ?.
If one ' s all three doshas vata , pitta and kapha are balanced then he is healthy.
If the seven elements maintaining the body juice , blood , flesh , fat , skeleton , marrow and virility are in appropriate ratio then that person is healthy.
Besides this if the process of excretion happens in proper way and the ten senses ears , nose , eyes , skin , taste , anus , genitalia , hands , legs and tongue , mind and their master soul is also happy then such person is also called healthy.
For the attainment of health diet , sleep and celibacy are the three pillars.
This body is supported on these three bases itself.
One whose diet , pleasure , thought and behavior are balanced and controlled he is yogi.
One in whose work there is divinity , there is always purity and longing for well-being in the mind , whose sleeping and waking up is regular only he is the true yogi.
A person 's body is formed by the diet.
Diet has a great effect not only on the body but also on the mind.
In relation to the diet an illustration by Maharishi Charaka is very elegant.
Once upon a time Maharishi Chakra asked his disciples who is healthy ?.
The one who has food which is beneficial in proper quantity and in consonance with weather is healthy.
Know your nature vaata , pitta , kapha and take the food accordingly.
If it is vaata nature there is air defect in the body then shun gassy food like rice etc.and sour food.
One should continue using small dried catkins , dry ginger , etc.
Those with pitta nature should not take hot , fried products.
Raw food like long gourd , pumpkin , cucumber , etc.are beneficial.
Those with kapha nature should not take cold food rice , curd , buttermilk etc.should not take in excess quantity.
One should take milk by mixing , small dry catkins , turmeric etc.in it.
Food should be taken in appropriate quantity.
Half of the stomach is for food , keeping one-fourth for the drinks it is appropriate to leave the rest for the air.
By taking the food by matching it according to the season diseases do not come near.
Food taken at wrong time produces illness by causing indigestion.
In the morning in between eight to nine it is good to take light drink , fruit etc.
The less the use of food in the morning , the better it is for the body.
It is better if the people of above fifty years do not take Praataraasha.
It is best to take food in the forenoon from eleven to twelve o'clock.
The time from twelve to one is medium , after the time is successively bad.
In the evening the time from seven to eight is best , time from eight to nine is medium and after nine it becomes successively bad.
Due to talking during eating , the food could not be chewed well and more food is also eaten.
Therefore while taking food one should keep quiet by remembering Lord Rama and eat the food by chewing well.
A mouthful should be chewed thirty two times or at least twenty times.
One also gets freedom from violent thoughts by eating by chewing because we all know that when someone is angry the person begins to grinds his teeth.
The origin of anger is teeth.
If we want to end the violent feelings then we should pay special attention to chewing while eating.
You will yourself experience the chewing of food then you will become aware of its results.
One should do three rinse in the beginning of meal by remembering om or reciting mantras like Gayatri mantra.
One should not drink water in the middle of the meal.
If the food is surly then one could drink a little water.
Do n't drink more than two-three sips of water after the meal.
If there is buttermilk then one should drink it.
There is a shloka in Sanskrit , which implies - One who takes breakfast in the morning , drinks milk after dinner at the night and drinks buttermilk after lunch in the noon he does not need a doctor.
Means that person remains healthy.
Along with this our meal should be completely appropriate for us.
There should be abundant mineral , salt and Vitamin-B in the meal.
Meat , eggs etc.should not be used in the meal.
God has made us vegetarian.
When we can survive by eating roti in which there is no violence then what is the need of ending the dear life of any organism by killing it ?.
It is better to die than live like this.
Humanely qualities like kindness , compassion , empathy , love , affinity and devotion etc.end by eating meat.
Non-vegetarian human roams like a demon.
The stomach of a non-vegetarian is like the cremation ground.
Sleep is in itself is a complete pleasant sensation.
If a person could not sleep then he can also become insane.
From outside sleep does not seem anything , but those who are not able to sleep only they know what its importance is.
Sleep of 6 hours is enough for a healthy person.
For young boys and old people it is appropriate to sleep for eight hours.
Sleeping early in the evening and waking up early in the morning makes the life of a person improved.
God has bound the Nature in such rules that in the evening humans and other such creatures , animals , birds begin to take rest at their respective places.
Barring owl , bat etc.all other birds get engaged in their work by remembering God as soon as the dawn arrives.
The cock gives the message of not sleeping during the dawn.
Birds are seen eulogising the name of God with beautiful songs.
Unfortunate human wakes up throughout the night like an owl and keeps lying down without taking the pleasure of this dawn.
In the end the humans become ill.
We should also take inspiration from dumb animals.
Sleeping early and waking up early makes the person healthy and great.
The way diet is necessary to carry this body , similarly there is extreme necessity of asana-pranayama , exercise etc.
Without exercise the body becomes ill and watery and dull.
While by doing exercise regularly even weak , ill and ugly person becomes strong , healthy and handsome.
The main reason behind heart disease , diabetes , obesity , rheumatism , gastric , blood pressure , mental stress etc.is also the lack of exercise.
If we exercise regularly then we could never get affected by these diseases.
There are many types of exercise also.
Among all these asana-pranayama is the best.
In other exercises there is definitely physical work but concentration and peace does not come to the mind.
By doing heavy exercise only muscles are exercised.
By doing heavy exercise nerves are not exercised.
Therefore by heavy exercise the muscles become so hard that slowly blood-flow stops in them and pain begins.
While with asana-pranayama there is complete health benefit and there is no loss of any kind.
Along with body concentration and peace develops in the mind.
After asana etc.one should take bath after the temperature of the body becomes normal.
By bathing freshness comes to the body , the unwanted heat is satiated and the body becomes pure and light.
Body becomes pure by water.
Mind becomes pure by truth.
Soul becomes serene by learning and penance and mind by knowledge.
Except the ill people normal people should take bath with cold water.
Diseases like weak digestion and weak-vision etc.may occur by taking bath with the hot water.
Hair begin to gray and fall untimely.
Unnecessary heat increases in the body to cause the reduction of minerals.
The body should be rubbed well by a khadi towel after bathing.
This increases radiance.
If there is constipation then stomach should also be rubbed with the dry towel.
If one could bath by swimming in river , pond etc.then it is the best.
The people having desire for pleasure , peace and happiness should meditate on God , pray everyday for at least 15 minutes to one hour after completing the daily activities like toilet , bathing , asana , etc.
The recitation of Pranav and Gayatri mantra etc.for long time and with devotion gives extreme strength , peace and pleasure.
After the attainment of asana the controlling of speed of breathing process as per your capability is called pranayama.
According to the yogadarshana there are four kinds of pranayama Bahyavritti , Abhyantarvritti , Stambhvritti , Bahyabhyantar - Vishayakshepi.
In the Bahyavritti pranayama procedure exhale the breathe as per your strength by sitting in siddhasana or padmasana as per the procedure.

In Stambhavritti pranayama all the three bandhas could be applied.
In Bahyabhyantar - Vishayakshepi pranayama process when the breath comes in , then stop a little outside and when it goes out from inside , then keep on stopping a little inside.
When pranavayu begins to go out from inside , then for not letting it out take apana vayu from outside to inside against it.
And when this apana vayu begins to come in from outside , then keep on stopping the speed of the apana vayu also by pushing your pranavayu from inside to outside.
In this if you act against each other , then by the stopping and coming of both the pranas in one 's own control mind and senses also come sin our control.

How important is water for our life , everybody knows this.
The basis of the life on earth is only the water and water is an invaluable resource for this Earth.
The use of water is as much necessary in every phase of life as breathing.
There are many similarities in the eco system of the Earth and our body.
The way the development of human civilisation has taken place along with the presence of water , similarly the physiology of our body is completely dependant on water.
Actually , the human body is made up of 70 % water as per nature.
Water is found from human cells to bones , muscles and blood.
How much water is necessary for which part of the body , this is controlled by the endocrine system present in the body.
The responsibility of taking the nutrients and the waste products of the body from one place to the other in a systematic manner is only of the water.
First of all our mind is affected by the deficiency of water or bad quality of the water.
In the case of dehydration the first symptoms of deficiency of water is seen when there is 2 % deficiency of water in the body.
In order to stop this dehydration our skin and hair become that delicate barrier which ensures that the water present in the body is lost as little as possible.
The research on water by the computer and scientists recommend that how and in what quantity should we use the water present in our body along with the Earth.
Along with this there are also many researches on the relationship that the water has with the healthy skin.
When the natural shine of the skin begins to diminish because of the deficiency of water then wrinkles begin to appear on the skin.
The elasticity of the skin also begins to be lost by the skin remaining dry for the long time.
The effect of the age begins to show explicitly on the skin by the skin being dry for the long time.
During this time NMF is finished , the cells are not able to develop properly because of the end of the water.
On not paying attention to the dry skin on the upper surface the dryness of the skin does the work of harming the natural beauty by reaching deep inside layer by layer.
On reaching this point the cells of the skin begins to hang in the form of wrinkles by leaving its naturalness.
In order to give a healthy form to the skin it is necessary that it is nourished by those products , which nourishes the skin by making a proper balance of the water.
Along with the skin the presence of water in the hair is also very essential.
No matter how good a hairtyle is made with the rough and lifeless hair , its flourishing results will not come to the fore.
In order to get rid of the dry and lifeless hair it is necessary that the moisture present in the hair should be preserved from time to time.
Our hair produce serum naturally , which keeps the moisturizer of the hair balanced.
But along with this serum makes our hair dirty by making it sticky.
In order to remove this dirt we have to wash our hair regularly.
In this process the fiber of our hair along with the skin of our skull are harmed.
By using these necessary products on our skin the proper quantity of water is maintained in the skin and it does not lose its natural properties.

Balanced diet is necessary for becoming beautiful.
In order to become slim some women abstain from eating itself and then becomes the victim of new problems.
In general the women of three or four size are considered healthy and beautiful in India.
Being healthy is more important than being thin.

Which size is proper for the airhostess , this will be deliberated upon , but the effect of the ruling will also fall on the society along with the fashion world , the medical word.
Models lose their life in the pursuit of zero size.
Like Luisell Ramos used to eat only a few leaves and drank coke.
Luisell Ramos died at the age of 22 years by heart attack.
The model of Brazil Annacarolina was surviving on apple and tomato , the system of her body failed in the absence of strength.
A healthy woman needs 2 ,000 calories in a day , but in the pursuit of becoming thin the girls try to survive on even less than 800 calories.
In the desire to be thin their body becomes deficient in calcium , zinc , iron , folic acid.
Vomitting after eating more than required , removing flesh from the body , getting operated upon , fasting , exercising more these are some of the methods , by which the movement of reducing weight is on in innumerable homes , gyms , beauty parlors.

Keeping your health in your mind you can balance your weight with some methods.
Atking diet is the low carbohydrate diet.
In this diet carbohydrate is not included and its deficiency is accounted for by fat and protein intake.

Balnced diet is necessary for becoming beautiful but in order to become slim some abstain from eating itself and then becomes the victim of new problems.
Along with this if you have to sometimes take high fat diet then keep it in mind that the it has less amount of calories.
According to Akting diet by taking the meal of 25 gram less carbohydrate everyday the glycogen accumulated in our muscles slowly begin to diminish in about 48 hours.
Along with this our body begins to use fat for the energy , which reduces our weight quickly.
Till the time the level of insulin will low because of less carbohydrate in the body the fat will have no effect on the body.
Take protein in excess quantity.
The quantity of protein should be about 6-85 gram everyday.
The amount of carbohydrate should be 0-30 gram everyday.

Although the problems related to the abdomen and the intestine are not fatal , but it creates anxiety , discomfort and pain in a large quantity.
The indications , symptoms and complaints in the diseases related to the abdomen and intestine are so similar that most of the doctors give some anatacid to the patient without arriving at a definite treatment , which reduces the symptoms to a large extent.
Since most of the diseases are so chronic , repetitive or prolonged in nature that it gets temporary relief.
After getting the relief once they forget the treatment and the medicine , and as a result of this the disease may surface again in the future.
Peptic ulcer acidic peptic disease ADP occurs because of the erosion or formation of ulcer in the internal parts of the abdomen.
Paeptic ulcer may occur because of excessive secretion of the gastric juice which melts or erodes the abdominal lining.
Peptic ulcer may occur because of the failure of the resistance system which reduces the loss because of the acid of the abdominal walls.
There is an extreme pain near the naval because of the formation of ulcer in the abdomen , the problems like vomiting etc could occur.
In many cases the gastric juice acid melts even the walls of the veins , which circulates blood in the abdomen.
There could be the secretion of black scum which is called melina and blood secretion in the abdomen because of the melting of the walls of veins.
Gastro Oesophysial Reflex ' or ` GERD ' is one such disease , in which the acid of the stomach goes into food pipe by reflex or moving backwards , whose internal lining is not resistant to the acid.
In this way that area is burnt.
There is a burning sensation or chest pain right in the middle of the chest which is called ` heart burn '.
This heart burn produces the illusion of angina or heart pain.
Simple gas or formation of air is not any disease in itself.
In this condition belching exit of air through the mouth or flatulence exit of air through the anus increases.
Some specific materials like-milk , sprouts , cauliflower , cucumber , specific types of pulses produces the gas-related symptoms and condition in some people.
The problem of gas could also occur because of taking in excessive air while taking meal.
But gas could not be said to be any disease except the one producing restlessness.
We have to say only this that recognize and avoid such food which produces gas.
Gastro Oesophysial Reflex Oesophagytis generally produces the illusion of angina or heart pain.
This pain could also be reduced by ` sorbitret ' because sorbitret also relaxes the oesophigal muscles , which reduces the pain.
Angina related illusion could be removed with the help of the ECG.
The pain of oesophagitis does not increase by walking or labor.
Stomach is an important part of the abdominal digestion.
The shape of the stomach is like that of a sack.
Stomach is situated in between the oesphagus and intestines.
Abdomen is present in almost all the organisms.
Human stomach is an elastic , muscular pear-shaped bag , which is situated in the blank space across abdomen below the diaphragm.
Abdomen changes its shape and type according to the condition of the body itself.
Abdomen is about 12 inch 30.5 cm long and 6 inch wide 15.2 cm at its most stretched point.
The capacity of the abdomen in an adult is 1 fudge 0.94 litre.
The food comes to the stomach through oesophagus.
The contact point of oesophagus and abdomen are called lower oesophageal or ` gastro estro oesophageal sphincter.
This sphincter in the abdomen stops the food from going back into the oesophagus.
After the food reaches into the stomach gastric juice is used for the fragmentation of the food.
Some materials are absorbed by the muscule lining of the abdomen.
Wine is included in those materials whose absorption takes place in the abdomen itself.
The other part of the abdomen ` dudaenum ' remains empty.
Dudaenum is the first part of the small intestine.
Pyleric sphincter separates the stomach from the dudaenum.
Abdomen is made up of five layers.
If we look towards outside from the internal part then the most internal first layer is called ` mucosa '.
The formation of acidic and digestion juice takes place in the mucosa.
The layer after this is called ` submucosa '.
In the emty condition the abdomen shrinks and mucosa and submucosa fold , which is called ` ruge '.
When the food comes in it then ruge expands again.
Submucosa is surrounded by ` musculeris ' that layer of muscle which the edible products get in the abdomen and produces speed in them.
The other two layers ` subsirosa ' and ` sirosa ' does the job of wrapping the abdomen in one way.
Sirosa is the most outer layer of the abdomen.
If the internal lining of the abdomen is seen by the lens then it could be seen that it is covered by several small holes.
These small holes are the doors of gastric pits which is spread straight and in the form of branched tubewell till mucosa.
These small holes of the internal lining of the abdomen forms the gastric glands.
Mainly four kinds of secreting ` epihelium cells ' cover the abdominal surface and elaborated or spread till gastric pits and glands.
Mucous cells secrete basic mucous which saves the epithelium with excessive stress and acid.
Parietal cells ' secrete hydrochloric acid or if said in simple terms then acid.
Main cells secrete pepsin which is protiolytic enzyme for the fragmentation of protein.
G cells ' secrete the gastrine hormone.
Because of the basic mucous layer internal layer of the abdomen the abdominal walls are saved from burning by the acid secreted by ` parietal cells '.
Before entering the food into the stomach , the food is brought into the shape by the mouth and mixed into the saliva by chewing.
Abdomen carries out the four basic works , which helps in the primary stages of the diestion.
These four works of food prepares the food for the processing by the intestines.
The abdomen works as a long term reservoir , in which the food could be taken in large quantity and they could be used for long time by stroing them.
It is the abdomen itself where the digestion with chemical and enzymes is started , especially that of protein.
The quick shrinking of gastric muscls is helpful in mixing the food with the gastric secreted materials.
As a result of this the food converts into liquid material in the stomach which prepares it for entering into the small intestine.
As soon as the food converts into liquid material in the stomach , it enters into the small intestine for further procesing.
Ulcer is an open wound or boiler which is found on the normal skin or the mucous membrane region of the body.
The ulcer present in the lining of stomach or dusenum where hydrochloric acid or pepsin is present is called peptic ulcer.
When this ulcer occurs in the stomach then it is called gastric ulcer.
When the ulcer occurs in dudenum then it is called dudenal ulcer.
It was believed in the earlier times that the lifestyle-related reasons like stress and diet become the reason behind ulcer.
After this the researchers have established that hydrochloric acid and pepsin are also responsible for the formation of ulcer.
Peptic ulcer develops because of helicobacter pailori bacterium.
The research has made it clear that most of the ulcers occur because of infection with a bacteris helicobacter pailori.
Helicobacter pailori bacteria produces such mateials which weakens the mucous giving protection to the abdomen.
Because of the weakening of mucous acid and pepsin there is fatal effect on the abdomen and the formation of acid and pepsin begins even more quickly.
The studies have told that the possibility of ulcer increases by smoking.
There is also a negative impact on the treatment of ulcer by smoking and the possibility of increase in ulcer increases.
Caffeine increases the process of acid formation , which increases the pain in the already formed ulcer.
However the increase in the secretion of acid in the abdomen is not just because of the caffeine.
Till now no direct relationship between peptic ulcer and the consumption of wine has become present.
But the established ulcer is found in large quantity in those persons , who have sirosis of liver and which is related to greater consumption of wine.
Although emotional stress is now not considered the main reason behind ulcer , yet the people suffering from ulcer complains that the pain of ulcer increases by emotional stress.
Physical stress could increase the danger of development of ulcer , especially in the abdomen.
In order to stop the ulcer from developing and stopping its complications there is a need for extensive treatment.
It is believed that the deficiency in the capacity to protect oneself from strong digestive materials of the abdomen like hydrochloric aci and pepsin is a big reason of the formation of ulcer.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory NSAIDs drugs like aspirin , ibruffen and naeproksen increases the dangerous effeect of acid and pepsin in the abdomen.
These medicines are commonly present in the headache , small pain killers.
Following are the common symptoms of the occurrence of ulcer , however this symptom is different in different people.
Ulcer does not always manifest some symptoms , but the common symptom of ulcer is the burning pain or glowing in between the chest bone and the naval.
This pain of ulcer is generally felt in between the two meals and in the morning time.
The duration of this pain of ulcer could be from few minutes to few hours.
The symptoms of abdominal and dudenal ulcer could be similar to other digestive conditions or general medical problems.
Please consult your doctor for the proper treatment of ulcer.
Serious complications could arise because of not taking proper treatment at proper time by the people suffering from ulcer.
Since ulcer erodes the muscles of abdominal and dudenum walls , which could lead to damage in the blood capillaries.
The reason behind damage to the blood capillaries could be blood secretion.
Sometimes ulcer creates a hole by eating up the abdominal or dudenal wall , due to which bacteria and half-digested food jumps to the abdominal cavity paritonium which increases the infection in abdominal cavity and the wall.
The ulcer situated at the other end of the abdomen where dudenum is attached causes swelling and wound , due to which the entrance of the intestine is closed.
Because of this reason by blockage the food could not come out of the abdomen and could not enter into the small intestine , due to which there is vomiting of materials present in the abdomen.
How can one detect the ulcer ?.
Since different kinds of methods are used for the treatment of different kinds of ulcers , therefore the correct treatment of ulcer or H Pylori is necessary before the treatment.
For example the treatment of ulcer produced by NSAID is very different from the ulcer produced by H Pylori.
There are many options for the correct treatment of the ulcer.
Similarly necessary options are available for the treatment of H.Pylori.
Included among these processes of treatment is upper GI Gastrointestinal Series.
In gastrointestinal series a liquid material like chalk which is borium is given to the patient.
After this with the help of the x-ray of oesophaus , abdomen and dudenum the correct situation of the ulcer is examined.
In endoscopy a flexible instrument at the other end of which a camera is fixed is inserted into the oesophagus , abdomen and udenum through the mouth , so that the upper pipe could be seen completely.
The testing of blood , respiration and abdominal tissues is carried out to find out the presence of H.Pylori.
In earlier times doctors used to give the patients the suggestion to keep away from fried , acidic , spiy and food having fat.
However for the right treatment of ulcer bland food has no longer remained effective.
Those people who find it that some foods create restlessness in them they should consult their doctor.
Smoking is related to ulcer not being cured and its being born again , therefore ulcer infected people should not smoke.
Doctors treat the ulcer of abdomen and dudenum with the following medicines.
H2 blocker reduces the quantity of acid in the abdomen by stopping the repoduction of histamin which is responsible for secreting acid in the abdomen.
There is a complete seizure of production of acid in the abdomen by the medicines for stopping the pump of acid.
By this acid pump the main place of acid secretion is stoped.
Antacid  ` mucozal protective agent ' is used to protect the mucous lining of the abdomen from the harm caused by the acid.
Antacid.Mucozal protective agent does not reduce the secretion of acid.
During the treatment of H.Pylori these medicines are used with other antibiotics.
The discovery of relation between ulcer and H.Pylori has given birth to a new alternative antibiotics treatment.
In most of the cases the anti ulcer-medicines cures the ulcer quickly and effectively.
By these medicines with the end of H.Pylori the possibility of ulcer coming up again reduces.
However those patients on whom the medicines are not effective or who slowly develop complexities , they may need operation.
In today 's times laproscopic surgery is being brought into use for the treatment of ulcer.
In ` vagotiomy ' process vagus a nerve which functions to send the message from the mind to the abdominal nerve is being cut so that the signal could be stopped and the secretion of acid could not take place in the abdomen.
In ` entrectomy ' the lower portion of the stomach is removed because it produces a hormone which is responsible for the secretion of digestive juice in the stomach.
Pyloriplasty ' is that operation which could also be done with vagotomy.
In the pyloriplasty operation dudenum and small intestine pylorus are made bigger such that the activity of the edible materials could increase from the abdomen.
In the future the standard methods of laproscopic operation may become prevalent.
Laproscope is an instrument of a long tube with camera which the surgeopn enters into the skin after putting small cuts and looks at the internal activity on a video monitor.
Gastro oesophygal reflux disease GERD or reflux oesophegaitis is such a disease , in which the lower portion of the abdomen 's structure enters into the oesophagus due to which the lining of its soft part is destroyed by the acid.
As a result of this there is burning sensation in the upper portion of the abdomen which is called epigastric and lower middle chest.
Heart burn , burning sensation or restlessness in the chest bone or behind the sterman are the most common symptoms of acidity.
Along with this return of gastric material in the mouth or chest regurgitation may happen.
Oesophagus is a big pipe which takes the food from the empty place in the mouth to the stomach in the abdomen.
Oesophagus crosses the chest and passes through diaphragm.
Whenever the food comes in the upper protion of the oesophagus , this pipe starts a kind of activity , which is called ` peristalsis ' in which the food is brought from oesophagus to the abdomen below.
It takes less than one minute to bring the food or liquid material into the door of the mouth.
Here the acid secreted from the abdomen begins the digestive work on this food.
At the lower end of this pipe there is a gate protected by a thumb like muscles which keeps the lower part sealed so that the food material does not come back to oesophagus after reaching in the abdomen.
Among the main reasons of GERD unstable lower oesophigial sphincter relaxation , reduced LED resting tone , ineffective oesophigial clearance in the emptying of abdomen and deficiency in the production saliva are included.
The most common symptom of GERD is heart burn.
The most posibility of occurrence of GERD is after the lunch in the day.
Some people feel the reflux during the sleep also.
The relation of nocturnal reflux while sleeping at the night is generally with more dangerous and excessive oesophigitis.
In this the acid remains in the oesophagus for longer time.
Because there is deficiency in the quantity of production and swallowing of saliva for deactivating the acid.
The determination of the symptoms of the loss of oesophigial mucozal and its quantity mainly depends on the quantity of refluxed material and time of the contact of acid in the oesophigial.
In the patients suffering from the acidity their internal mucozal resistance system is affected by the excessive reflux , which produces many other symptoms also.
There are many options for the treatment of the GERD , in which change in normal lifestyle to treatment are included.
The motive of the treatment of the GERD is to reduce or end its symptoms.
To reduce its repetition and the time period of the disease.
To fill up the damage of the damaged cells of the oesophagus.
The motives of the treatment of GERD are to avoid the spicy , fatty and fried food.
Exercising regularly and reducing the excessive weight of the body could be a good beginning towards the prevention of GERD disease.
Try to take the meal two hours before sleeping.
Keeping the head of one 's bed slightly high could also be beneficial in the GERD disease.
Most of the food materials which have carbohydrate could be the reason for gas.
The food materials opposite to this which have fat or protein , produces less fat.
Raphinage , lacose , fructos and sarbitol are small carbohydrate.
This complex quantity of carbohydrate is found more in raphinage beans.
However comparatively it is in less quantity in cauliflower , sprouts , broccolli , other vegetables and whole cereals.
The natural sharcara present in the milk is called lactose.
Lactose is also found in sufficient quantity in milk products like cheese , ice cream , processed food like bread , cereals and salad dressing.
Fructose is naturally found in onion , pineapple and wheat etc.
Fructose is used to produce sweetness in drinks and fruit juice.
Sorbitol is that sarcara which is naturally found in the fruits in which apple , pineapple , peach and prune are included.
It is used to bring artificial sweetness in dietic food materials and sarcara-less toffees and chewing gums.
Most of the starch , in which potato , cereal , noodles and wheat etc are included , they produce gas because their disintegration and digestion takes place in the large intestine.
Rice is the only starch which is not responsible for producing gas.
Generally all vegetables and fruits are considered good source of fiber.
Any food material which is with peel has fibers.
Whole cereals , pulses with covering also have fibers.
In many food materials there are soluble and insoluble fiber.
Soluble fiber dissolves in the water easily and forms a soft jail like shape in the intestines.
Soluble fiber is found in the barley floor , in the peas , in the beans and in most of the fruits.
The disintegration and digestion of soluble fiber does not take place until it does not reach large intestine , where the digestion leads to the production of gas.
On the other hand insoluble fiber passes through the intestines without any change and produces less gas.
Insoluble fiber produces less gas.
Insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran and some vegetables.
Those food mateials which could produce gas in some people , they may not have any effect on the others.
Some common bacteria present in the large intestine may destroy the hydrogen produced by the other bacteria.
The balance of these two bacteria explains the fact that why gas is formed in some people in larger quantity than in the others.
Gas is produced in almost every person , which is issued out either by belching or through stool.
Although many people think that they have a greater gas problem while in reality its quantity is normal.
Most of the people produce 1 to 3 pint gas everyday and pass the gas around 14 times everyday.
Gas is primarily formed by the mixture of odourised vapor carbon dioxide , oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen and sometimes methane.
The unpleasant odourof flatulence comes by that bacteria which is situated in the large intestine and which produces such gas , which has sulphur.
Although the production of gas is common , but sometimes it produces restlessness and other conditions.
Understanding the reasons behind gas , paying attention to the methods of its reduction and treatment at the right time could only give riddance from this problem.
Swallowing the air is a common reason behind gas in the abdomen.
Every person swallows the air in some quantity while eating or drinking.
However eating or drinking quickly , smoking or wearing the loose artificial teeth etc also become the reason behind ` aerophisia ' in some people.
Burping or hiccup is that process in which nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide which is swallowed along with the air etc exit from the abdomen.
The remaining gas goes into the small intestine , where its partial absorption takes place.
Its small quantity also goes into the large intestine where it exits through the way of rectum.
When the acid and bicarbonate are mixed in the abdomen , then carbon dioxide is also produced from the abdomen , but a large part of this gas is absorbed in the blood flow and does not enter into the large intestine.
Those people in whom there is production of methane gas in larger quantity , it is not necessary that some special indication be present in them.
The stool of that person , in whom there is greater production of methane , continues to flow in the water.
The research has not been able to find why there is greater production of methane in some people when compared to the other people.
Otis flow ' disease generally takes place in the children.
Otis flow disease occurs in the middle of the ear because of the germs.
This disease of otis flow could also occur because of syphilis , tonsilitis and old cough.

Clean the ear by putting hydrogen peroxide in the ear.
Later on put in the cotton after pouring mercurochrome glycerin or aecriolect.
After dropping few drops of boric spirit in the ears and cleaning the ears in some time close it with the cotton.
In this disease injections of penicillin , strepo-penicillin , comaisin etc are beneficial.
Sometimes the pieces of gram , pea or cotton etc enter into the ear of children or adults , which are not able to come out and the patient feels very uncomfortable and laziness.
If it is not possible to remove the object in the ear for some time because of swelling etc then warm it by mixing boric acid in the hot water and spray the boric lotion in the ear after the swelling subsides.
By this the object fallen in the ear will be removed from its place and could be easily removed with the help of tweezers or matchstick.
It should be kept in mind that if insects enter into the ear then for removing that instead of using tweezers or matchstick one should fill it with the hot mustard oil so that the insect or any other thing gets drowned.
This way the object fallen in the ear could be easily removed.
Those people who do not clean their teeth , the disease of germs in their teeth is more widespread.

In the study this fear is said to be baseless that there is negative impact on the consumption of milk by the consumption of fruit juice.
This study has also found the argument of arrival of obesity in children because of 100 percent consumption of fruit juice to be wrong.
According to Dr.Nicholas The condition of obesity in children has nothing to do with the hundred percent consumption of fruit juice.
This kind of research has proved that there is no danger of obesity in children because of hundred percent consumption of fruits.
As opposed to this there is a greater danger of obesity in the children who do not drink juice.
Dr.Nicholas says , We have found that those children who do not take fruit juice , they have a grater danger of becoming obese.
Not only this , this fact has also come to the light by this research that juice consumers eat more fuit than non-juice consumers.

In about 70 percent injuries of chest facture occurs in ribs.
At the same time muscles of chest get damaged.
In about 80 percent people lungs get seriously damaged along with occurrence of rib fracture.
As a result of this blood and air fill up inside the chest.
Filling up of air inside chest is called pneumothorax while filling up of blood is called hemothorax.
If both these conditions are not treated immediately then in 80 percent cases there is a chance of death of a patient.
Therefore on occurrence a chest injury one should begin treatment under the surveillance of an experienced thoracic surgeon or danger increases.

It has two disadvantages.
One that they waste the precious time received for treatment , second right assessment of injured lung does not happen and third , to escape from pain occurring in rib injury tight cloth is tied across the chest.
Sometimes chest is even plastered.
By it harm is caused to the patient instead of benefit.

With the very onset of winter season danger of diseases related to respiratory system increases.
With the slightest of negligence the upper respiratory system comes into grips.
A common health problem like cold arises.
Children and elderly come into the grips of cold soon as compared to adults.
Cold is a common disease of winter season which happens because of viral infection rhino virus.
This extremely mild virus attacks the nose from which itching in nose of patients , sneezes and water starts flowing from nose.
If throat also comes in grip of this virus then itching , pain and dry cough occur in throat.
Because of nose being blocked during cold patient has to breathe from mouth.
Patient afflicted with cold may also have heaviness in head , headache and slight fever.
Other than rhino virus during every seasonal change or whenever the physical constitution tries to expel toxic waste from inside the body.
When it is unable to come out through given means then it appears in form of some disease or the other.
Cold disease also falls in the same category.
Cold has direct relation with stomach.
This disease occurs on deterioration of digestion and improper purgation.
With the very occurrence of cold vijatiya  foreign fluid of body starts flowing from nose in the form of mucous.
Cold is a natural process of expulsion o waste material of body therefore on occurrence of cold hunger subsides naturally.
Taste of tongue goes away.
To contribute in this natural process of body one should stop eating as soon as cold occurs.
On occurrence of cold you should stop any kind of smoking and drinking alcohol.
By their consumption bodily vitamin C reduces from which immunity in body lessens.
You should not take any medicine without advice of physician.
Cold is a waste expulsion process of body therefore if there is no acute condition then do not take any strong medicine to stop cold.
There is also harm from cold stopping altogether.
So that there is no infectious effect of cold therefore patient should take as much care of cleanliness as possible.
During sneezing patient should sneeze applying a towel only.
Spit , defecate , etc in such a place where you can flush or put mud immediately.
If cold does not heal in a week then one should take advice from a good doctor and should prevent cold specially because there is a possibility of pneumonia and bronchitis in such a state.
Firstly you should do natural treatment of cold in the form of first aid.
Firstly when you feel cold at that time itself keeping feet in hot water take a hot bath.

Just as you take a bath you should cover with blanket etc.
Perspiration will immediately occur by it.

If constipated stomach is heavy during a cold , there can be an ache in the head , in such a state keep taking lemon water all day.
While sleeping at night you should take half a spoon of powder of small harad with hot water by which loose motions clear in the morning.
Fast with removal of waste becomes helpful in a constitution of cold and in very less time cold heals with this small treatment itself.

The total amount of iron in body is 4 - 5 grams.
About 20 - 23 % iron gets accumulated in various tissues in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin.
About 2 - 3 % various enzymes cytochrome oxidase , catalase , peroxidase are in the form of residue.
Other than having oxygen the requirement of iron is for the various biochemical processes.
The problem of deficiency of iron is found in about half the population of the world.
It has become known from surveys that more than half men and two - third women in our country are afflicted with anemia because of deficiency of iron.
Tissues also get damaged from excess of iron , even death can occur.
The requirement of an adult male is of 1 mg iron daily.
Iron is in abundance in eggs , fish.
This iron is called ' heme iron '.
Its absorption from intestines is till about 10 % , whereas iron is also in green leafy vegetables , grains , pulses , its absorption from intestines happens with less ease.
Vitamin ' C ' acid secreted from urinary bladder increases its absorption whereas tea , husk , fiber , fitate , phosphate , phenal chemicals reduce its absorption.
Hence there is more possibilty of occurrence of deficiency of iron in vegetarians.
The absorption of iron from intestines depends on the iron accumulated in body.
From reduction of amount of iron in body its absorption from intestines increases whereas reduces from increased amount.
If absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful , it is insoluble and its use is unable to take place in body.
In blood iron stays joined with transferrin protein.
98 % iron is utilised in red blood cells in bone marrow for the production of hemoglobin.
It reaches the cells through blood and remain joined with ferritin protein in blood , this way iron is soluble and less harmful.
When required body can use it.
If amount of ferritin increases in cells then it turns into insoluble hemosiderin which can be harmful for body.
About one gram iron is accumulated mainly in liver cells and macrophage.
On the occurrence of requirement of iron accumulated in body body uses it.
The deficiency or excess of iron in body can be detected from blood iron level , transferrin and ferritin.
Deficiency of iron is present in half the population in the world.
The deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in adequate amount in food.
The अवशोषण of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less सुगमता from intestines hence possibilty of deficiency is more.
The requirement of iron in childhood , youth , pregnancy , increases.
So if iron is not consumed in additional amount then deficiency can occur.
From less absorption of iron in old age also the possibility of occurrence of anemia increases.
If iron comes out with blood with bleeding from body then also deficiency of iron occurs in body.
Deficiency of iron occurs from occurrence of hookworm infection intestines that suck blood , extreme bleeding during menses in women.
deficiency of iron can occur from bleeding from intestines or other body parts also.
There is special danger of iron deficiency in the poor category in children that do not drink milk , women , the aged.
In the second quarter of pregnancy more or less all women become victims of iron deficiency.
More serious problems occur because of excess of iron.
If capsules  tablets with more iron or food substances containing iron are consumed for a long time or more iron reaches inside body through other causes.
Tissues become damaged from the effect of the active free radicals being produced from excess of iron.
If because of thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , etc blood needs to be given at regular intervals then iron starts accummulating in body in more amount.
In some people absorption of iron from intestines takes place in large amount because of which also there can be excess of iron in body.
This disease is usually hereditary because of irregularity in genes.
This disease of excess of iron is called ' hemosiderosis '.
Spots appear on skin on iron reaching body in much amount.
Diabetes can occur from urinary bladder getting damaged.
Cirrhosis ' can occur from liver getting damaged , the possibility of liver cancer increases.
The seminal vesicles of men may get destroyed.
Weakness , fatigue takes place , one can become impotent , weight decreases , swelling and pain occurs in joints , vomit and vertigo occur.
The form of kidney may grow , hair fall , fluid may accumulate in stomach , heart diseases may occur.
The test of excess of iron can take place from blood iron transferrin , measure of ferritin level , biopsy of kidney.
Iron being in excess can be fatal , hence to take it out of body injections of desferal are given regularly.
On there being a continual necessity of giving blood you need to give these injections for 3 - 4 days slowly for 10 - 12 days.
This treatment if difficult and extremely expensive.
Now medicine that can be eaten in the form of a capsule , that makes iron from body ineffective has been developed.
Hopefully it will soon be available in country too.
In patients of hereditary hemosiderosis 450 ml blood is taken out every week so that excess of iron does not take place.
From this treatment there is no possibility of their death from diseases of heart , liver.
Nowadays it is often heard that a such and such person has allergy.
The more the use of modern synthetic medicines is increasing the more use of allergy is also increasing.
Hives  sheeta pitta , rash and leucoderma named diseases have been mentioned in ayurveda science , they come under the allergies of these days only.
Allergy or hives is a reaction of the body which is produced by eating or touching those substances which are not favourable to the constitution of individuals.
We call constitution being favourable shastra - satmya and unfavourable asatmya.
Some people get an allergy from wearing clothes made of synthetic thread.
In these people symptoms of allergy develop from eating some specific foreign medicines from which speed of breathing increases.
Pulse becomes weak and even death takes place from occurrence of shock and nervousness.
The people who get an attack of hives or allergy they should immediately use medicine.
If is unsuccessful in arrangements by oneself then one should not delay in sending to a good therapist or hospital without losing time.

Do this exercise morning - evening.
You will get rid of hypersomnia.
The name of indolence itself is disease.
Often people bring to fore an indolent life imagining happiness.
They pay for the adverse effects of this benediction much later.
Actually an indolent life looks happy from afar but its not like that.
Such a lifestyle does not give rise to one but many diseases.
One quiet murderer of these is diabetes which goes on making the body hollow from inside.
In ancient Indian lifestyle many kinds of exercises and yogas have hence been included.
Surya namaskar is such an exercise which makes parts of the whole body active but many people do not do it because they find it like a religious form.
With regular exercise many physical problems with diabetes can be kept at bay.
The young generation is more conscious of health as compared to the last generation.
This is the very reason that gyms and fitness centres are seen comparatively more.
Despite this surveys tell us that now this fatal disease has started hemming in from youth itself.
May the cause be a stressful lifestyle or an extra attachment towards fast food the number of patients of diabetes is increasing fast.
Skin happens to be the safety armor of our body its care needs to be taken all year round.
Every season brings challenges for the skin.
Dry weather soaks all the moisture of skin.
Many diseases house themselves as soon as oil safety armor moves away from dry skin.
It will be better that you take care of skin regularly so that lustre of skin sustains during extreme winters.
Children often have complaints of cold cough during winters.
If breathing related problems remain for a long time then the capacity of children to fight with disease decreases.
The cause of tuberculosis in children is also negligence.
Along with the season changing from rains to winter one has become victim of many skin related problems.
In winter season dryness in the atmosphere starts increasing.
From this skin starts getting dry.
Along with this in this season problems like sun allergy , winterege , insect allergy also appear.
One can prevent skin related problems with a little cautiousness and maintenance of skin.
Commonly people like the winter sun a lot.
So people spend more time in open sunlight which later on takes the form of sun allergy.
One likes this sunlight but being very strong it burns the skin.
One should use sunscreen on occurrence of sun allergy.
According to the environment of the capital one should use sunscreen of 20 - 30 SPF.
As long as possible keep skin covered.
One gets to see the problem of psoriasis also in winter season.
Psoriasis is called ' aprasa '.
Skin of palm and soles starts coming out.
Because of it often itching starts.
Red patches also appear.
Fungal infection also appears in winter season.
We call it shingles in common language.
Red patches start forming at different places in body.
The spots where this problem arises skin there becomes very dry.
One should consult with a doctor on appearance of such allergy.
Allergy starts arising in skin from insect bites also.
Sore like spots start forming in the open part of skin.
Burning sensation occurs in it , swelling also appears later on.

Skin starts becoming dry because of allergy.
It starts healing on its very own with increase in coldness.
To prevent it one should start using winter body lotion as soon as the season changes.
Those whose skin is very dry they need to take more care.
Walnut is the best source of protein.
There is also much fiber in them and antioxidants like vitamin - B , magnesium and vitamin - E are also there.
As such monosaturates and polyunsaturated fats are there in all kinds of kernels almond , cashew , pistachio , musk melon and water melon.
In all of these the place of walnut is totally different.
In walnut omega - 3 fatty acid is present in the largest amount than other kinds of kernels.
It has been found from researches going on for more than a decade that on including walnut in regular diet flexibility in blood vessels increases and chance of formation of clot becomes weak.
The quality most important than all of these in walnut is that ldl cholesterol responsible for heart disease and C - reactive protein reduces by it.
C - reactive protein has recently been said marked for heart disease.
Walnut is not only advantageous for heart diseases but for many other problems also.
Meaning walnut has a specifically important role in arthritis , providing relief from pain of joints.
Walnut can also be used for psoriasis and treatment of skin diseases.
Walnut can also be used as a laxative.
The fibers present in it prove to be helpful in providing relief from constipation.
It has found from researches that the people who eat walnuts regularly do not have liver problems.
Tuberculosis : This disease happens from mycobacteria.
Every year about 30 lakh people die of this disease.
In this most deaths occur in developing countries.
In the world about 80 lakhs new tuberculosis patients are increasing , in which 95 % are in developing countries.
At any time there remain about one and a half to two crores of tuberculosis patients in the world in which tuberculosis bacteria remain present in the expectoration of half the patients.
In India tuberculosis bacteria are present in about 40 % of the population and every year 5 lakh deaths occur from tuberculosis.
Every minute somewhere or the other someone is dying of tuberculosis.
One patient of tuberculosis in whose expectoration tuberculosis bacteria are present is spreading the disease every year in 10 to 15 new people.
When tuberculosis disease is present in the country with such horridness then even children can not escape it.
When a tuberculosis patient coughs or sneezes then tuberculosis bacteria come out in thousands.
Their large drops do drop on the ground but minute drops keep floating in the air.
Tuberculosis patients are mostly poor , uneducated , where the whole family lives in a small closed room.
The number of bacteria in the room increases from coughing continuously which reach the bodies , lungs and other body parts of other family members through breath.
Children who stay weak immediately come in their grip.
It produces a reaction on reaching the lungs of children.
Finishing one cycle in 8 - 10 weeks bacteria reaches the stage of dormant.
During this children may have common fever , cough , cold , coryza , etc which heals even without treatment but some children who are malnourished , are afflicted with some other serious disease or whose disease resistance capacity is weak , such a child needs treatment urgently.
Other than lungs tuberculosis can influence any part of body.
Its diagnosis in children is very difficult.
Only clever specialist therapists can diagnose it on time.
On getting health test of child you can get a diagnosis from conducting some blood tests and x - ray , sonography.
One another tuberculin test is also conducted whose report is received after 48 to 72 hours.
Tuberculin test being positive shows that bacteria of tuberculosis have entered the child.
In emaciated and sick , weak children this test may be negative even in presence of tuberculosis.
This test may be negative in those children also whose disease resistance capacity is weak.
Once diagnosis has been done one can get free of this disease on taking medicine regularly for six months under the care of a therapist.
Child can get seriously ill on not getting diagnosis or treatment on time or child can lose life.
Therefore always be aware and on occurrence of doubt get advice of a wise specialist doctor.
If these symptoms exist in children then there may be tuberculosis.
Weight of child not increasing or remaining stable or reducing a little.
Feeling weak.
Recurrence of fever in child.
Eyes getting red with fever.
Occurrence of coughing breath and weight not increasing.
Occurrence of sudden pain in chest and fever.
Pain in stomach and distension of stomach.

Coughing , pain in chest with phlegm to older child and decrease in weight.
Such a child who is not fully healthy even on healing of measles , whooping cough or disease of tonsils in throat.
Child has no problem in urination even then coming of pus or blood in urine.
On occurrence of any of the above symptoms consult with a specialist doctor.
Bad breath because of diabetes , shaking of molars or teeth , growth of gaps between the teeth , etc kind of disorders occur.
In the above situation one should increase the dose of medicines and get tested from a good doctor.
During treatment we met many such patients who had no knowledge of diabetes.
On seeing condition of gums and from other symptoms one detects the possibility of disease of diabetes which can be determined in pathology from testing the blood.
Dentists talk about extracting teeth merely on occurrence of a decrease in sugar amount in patient.
There is a wrong conception in some dentists that until blood sugar reduces wound will not heal from extraction of tooth.
Since this conception is produced because of misunderstandings hence from the point of view of the masses it is not an easy task to extract it.
Believe that as and when you shaking or decaying tooth keep coming out your graph of blood sugar will slowly start coming down.
Keep in mind that blood flow in body is maximum in the upper part of body meaning in head and mouth.
When there would be more blood flow there would also heal soon.
From too much flow of blood in the mouth wound of diabetes patients with more blood heals like that of a normal person and sugar also reduces from extracting all shaking teeth.
Keep in mind that blood sugar increases in a situation of pus anywhere in body.
Pus situated in gums reduces along with extraction of teeth , accordingly blood sugar also reduces.
Test teeth of children every 3 - 4 months and make child brush from the age of one year.
Teeth of children will go bad soon from giving child too much chocolate , biscuit.
After a meal brush your teeth on gargling and after brushing at night surely floss.
Surely learn the appropriate method of brushing teeth.
Get your teeth cleaned by a dentist every year.
There is good and cheap treatment of decayed teeth in the initial stage.
Eating carrot , radish , apple , fruit , etc remains beneficial for gums.
Use extremely soft brush like super soft toothbrush and massaging gums is a very good exercise for teeth and gums.
Do not use toothpick  paper pin.
Colourful dentifrice brings harm to teeth and gums.
After extracting tooth surely place another teeth in the empty space.
Our hair increases naturally about 1.25 to 1.5 cm in one month.
There is direct effect of food habits on the rate of growth of length of hair.
Also there is a hereditary pattern in the rate of increase in length of hair.
Often patients come with a problem that their hair grows very slowly in length or do not grow more after growing till a definite length.
Such a problem can be distributed in the following types.
The rate of growth of length in hair remains very slow.
Hair does not increase more after increasing till a definite length.
With merely a little increase in length hair becomes brown and split at the ends.
The biggest cause of a problem of this kind is deficiency of nutritious substances and lack of proper care.
For the circle of hair to go on smoothly it is extremely necessary for the body to get iron , calcium , etc nutritious substances in the right amount.
This problem also arises because of not applying right oil in hair.
Not using the right shampoo is also its cause.
From use of harmful chemical comprising oil , shampoo , etc hair ends become split and brown.
Use of dryer on hair roots also stops hair growth and makes them rough and lifeless.
If hair is not trimmed for a long time then also growth of hair gets affected.
Because hair ends break on becoming lifeless and hair starts tangling in itself.
Hereditary reason or family pattern is also responsible for hair growth.
Because the composition of hair depends on the composition of hair of parents.
If deficiencies of nutritious substances are visible in patient then medicine for the purpose of fulfilment of nutritious substances should be given.
Also it is important to mind food habits.
Meal should comprise all nutritious substances.
Definitely consume milk.
Use the right ayurvedic oil in hair twice or thrice a week.
Shampoo should be ayurvedic.
Do not use any product consisting of harmful chemicals in hair.
Do not use dryer on hair roots.
Once a month definitely use henna consisting of herbal mixture in hair.
Save your hair from strong sun and strong wind.
In 4 - 5 weeks definitely get trimming of your hair done.
Environmental pollution also stopping its growth makes hair rough and lifeless.
Hence one should save hair from environmental pollution also.
Because rough and lifeless hair grow very less in length.
Do not use any kind of soap for washing hair.
There is high detergent in soap that causes damage to hair.
Some soaps in market come especially for hair one should not use them either.
After washing hair one should not dry it jerking at it.
Harm is caused to hair from it and growth in length also decreases.
Many people whose hair is curly have a complaint that their hair grow very less in length.
Often in this situation length of hair surely remains normal but hair turns round with growing in length hence growth in hair is visible less.
Hyperactivity in children is such a condition in which behavior of child presents many problems which are connected with lack of concentration.

For this there is no physical examination.
In a situation of doubt one can take help from a clinical psychologist.
In a situation of having the right diagnosis the most important responsibility is of guardians.
In such a situation their sensible balanced behavior can prove to be extremely memorable for children.
Scolding the child for everything , beating or overlooking every fault of his both situations may make the problem more complicated.
Homeopathy therapy process can prove to be very helpful in this situation.
Constitutional homeopathy treatment provides help for establishing the right coordination in higher brain centres.
Cold and arthritis go hand in hand.
As such people suffering from arthritis are in pain the whole year but this problem takes a serious form in winter and rains.
Even though if some things are kept in mind then one can prevent tension arising during this time.
Dr.R.K.Sharma , senior consultant of apollo hospital and joint replacement surgeon has to say that arthritis may seem like a distressing disease but saving oneself from cold , having regular exercise and healthy diet people suffering from arthritis can also enjoy the winter.
Seasons are sensitive for 70 to 85 percent people afflicted with arthritis.
Disease like rheumatoid arthritis is more distressing in winters.
The cause of rheumatoid arthritis can also be people being less active in winters.
Therefore in winters it is necessary to exercise everyday.
Also keep in mind the following things.
Joint pain becomes worse in winters hence take special care of yourself.
Overlook the stroll of early morning and late evening meaning wait for sunrise not for sunset.
Take your pet dog with you on a stroll.
Along with it you will be able to take pleasure of exercise and you will feel yourself to be spiritually fulfilled.
If you want to go out then wear such clothes that will give you warmth.
If you want to go out then it is necessary that there are adequate clothes on your body.

Have such a meal in which amount of fats and calories is less.
If weight is not too much take walnuts and dry fruits regularly.
Avoid too much fats , oily and non - veg food.
It is important to take healthy and balanced diet during winters.
As much as possible eat fresh fruits and vegetables.
Be careful in slippery places and prevent getting injured.
Go to a health club or a gym.
Participate in dancing or water aerobics.
On advice of the doctor you can use machines like a treadmill or exercise box.
Nowadays people are spending half their lives in office.
Bad times have made office duty so difficult that job has started affecting health of people.
If your weight is increasing because of office then it important to keep in mind some things.
You want to bathe , get ready and reach office on time but forget to have breakfast in this haste.
If you do not have breakfast then the routine of your meals gets upset and you overeat in lunch.
To ask truthfully it is a very big reason of weight increase.
Include those things in breakfast in morning which you can make easily or which may be easily available.
You can take things like brown bread sandwich with cornflakes or milk.
If there is a canteen in your office then you can eat something over there too but it should be healthy food and not fast food.
No matter how busy you are definitely take a lunch break of half an hour.
You can take this lunch break between 12 to 1.
It would be better than you have lunch with your colleagues.
This way you will be able to have lunch on time.
Take lunch break of 15 to 20 minutes.
This way you have a relaxed lunch and when you will be full you will not overeat during dinner.
This way the order of your meals will remain set.
If you have less time for lunch then you eat in a hurry but prevent this.
Do not play with your health because of five - ten minutes.
If eating out is a compulsion then instead of eating in a restaurant you can have a tiffin service.
If you reach from home to office and then directly from office to home then it is obvious that you must be unable to do any physical exercise.
So it is natural to be fat.
It will be better if you look for excuses for physical exercise.
You can go to buy things like vegetables , milk , bread for home.
You can go to drop children to the bus for school.
To reach office or bus you can use stairs instead of lift.
If you come to office by a vehicle then park the car as far from office as possible.
So even if it is a hundred steps but you will at least walk out of compulsion.
Some calorie will surely burn from strolling.
You start feeling sleepy after lunch and you have coffee to get rid of it.
First thing is that you prevent taking coffee , but if it ' s a compulsion then take less amount of coffee.
Actually caffeine present in coffee surely removes your lethargy but your weight may increase from the sugar present in it.।.
Whenever you feel lethargic drink water.
With increase in age many health problems surround you.
Elderly people are often surrounded with medicine.
On top of that bad memory increases difficulties more.
In taking medicine on time , keeping diet right memory always interferes.
In the direction of treatment of this forgetfulness American scientists have found a new way.
Scientists claim that from unusual activities like patting your forehead one may get help in reducing forgetfulness.
According to a report published in ' Aging Neuropsychology and cognition ' journal some unusual activities during eating medicine may keep memory sound.
Agua McDaniel ' of research has said that many elderly people make mistakes in taking medicine.
They either forget to take medicine or take more medicine than necessary.
From this medicine does not affect or its side effects start coming to the forefront.
Mc Daniels has said that for the resolution of this problem senior citizens may be given this advice that they take medicine staying in an unusual position like keeping one hand on forehead.
They have told that in school students and in experiments done on people of an age of more than 72 years its positive results have been seen.
Even a little negligence in winters can prove to be fatal for child or adult anyone.
Doctors say that in extreme cold possibility of hypothermia increases.
Heart of person in the grips of hypothermia suddenly stops working.
So the danger of death of patient arises.
Senior paediatrician Dr.J.S.Bhadauriya told that on not maintaining caution in winters new born or adult falls into the grip of hypothermia.
It is important for mothers that they breastfeed the infants.
Temperature remains in control with this.
There happens to be a temperature control center in the brain which keeps temperature of body maintained at 98.4 degrees.
Temperature control system of an infant is unable to become active soon hence it soon falls into the grips of hypothermia.
On occurrence of hypothermia to adults obstacle is produced in blood circulation , respiration and neuro system.
On occurrence of hypothermia these systems may stop working.
In a serious situation heart stops working from irregular heartbeat.
So possibility of death remains.
Mother should keep a new born stuck to her chest for an hour each three to four times a day.
To protect an infant from cold one should wrap cotton on his chest and keep.
One may wear clothes in many folds on body.
By wearing clothes in many folds the air that is between the folds keeps the air outside outside and the air inside inside.
Infant can fall in the grips of cold fever in winter.
People addicted to cocaine will now be able to get rid of intoxication.
American scientists have discovered such a bacteria that reduces addiction.
It will also stop death happening from drug overdose.
According to scientists cocaine esterase is found from the natural form of ' cocE '.
CocE ' breaks the components of cocaine.
The effect of intoxication reduces from ' cocE '.
The main author of the research Friedbert Weiss has said that the mutated bacteria DM CocE of this bacteria is more effective.
Weiss has said that the therapy that makes one quit drug addiction is not much effective but from consumption of cocE for a long time patient gradually reduces the consumption of cocaine himself.
Researchers found during the experiment that the rats remaining in contact with such a bacteria have eaten cocaine in less amount.
The effect of drug was also seen less in rats.
Doctors always give the advice of keeping the blood sugar in control because more glucose in blood invites diseases.
It has been found din a new research that danger on cancer increases from high blood sugar.
The possibility of cancer due to high blood pressure is more in women.
Swedish scientists have said that high blood pressure in men remaining for long time can prove to be fatal.
Scientist of Umiya university Dr.Tanja Stock has said test of blood sugar has been done in 274 , 126 men of 40 to 50 years and 275 - 818 women of Austria and Sweden.
Researchers found after a decade possibility of cancer has been found at a high level in patient of high blood sugar.
Stock has said that this does not mean that cancer occurs from glucose in blood.
But this tumor grows in cells many times faster.
From high blood sugar possibility of cancer produced in liver , gall bladder , anus and thyroid has been found more in men.
In women possibility of pancreas , urinary bladder , cervical and stomach cancer was dominant.
Research was published in the public library of science medicine journal.
Science program manager of world cancer research fund Dr.Panagiota Mitrou has said that from it the possibility increases that on controlling blood sugar danger of cancer can be reduced.
What do people not do for beauty , some give time to dieting or some makes rounds of the beauty parlor.
Do you know that along with beautification parlor also gives you many kinds of diseases.
If you are thinking of going to the parlor then be careful.
Nowadays because of the increasing interest towards beauty women of all ages have started arriving at the beauty parlor.
In these parlors many processes are used to provide beauty to every body part.
In beauty parlors artificial cosmetics like - gel , hair spray , perfumes , etc are also used.
From their use where your beauty blossoms momentarily there itself you also come back home bringing various diseases.
Very few women know of this truth that along with adornment of beauty they also bring along many dangerous diseases.
During facial and massage usually customer is made to lie down on a bed.
On those beds because of solutions falling on it during pedicure and manicure many infectious germs remain present which stick to the delicate body parts of women.
Skin with allergy heals only after a long treatment of many months.
Infection also spreads from brush , combs , roller pin , etc used in parlors because in parlors women of many kinds and categories come.
If a certain woman had dandruff in her hair then on bringing is use the same comb or brush by others dandruff in hair may occur.
In beauty parlors possibility of skin related allergy is more also possibility of eczema and contact dermatitis increases more.
In situations of contact dermatitis itching occurs and skin becomes red from where water starts secreting.
In a situation of occurrence of eczema skin becomes black and gets thick.
Later water starts secreting from it too.
Warts appear in viral infection from which tiny hard vesicles occur on skin.
From this tiny rashes like water form on skin.
Because of not sterilising blade , shaver or razor and from using the same on every customer fatal diseases like AIDS may occur.
Because blood comes out from cutting and tearing of skin from using these tools and if this happens with an HIV afflicted customer then his blood can easily spread HIV in other customers.
Mostly working women leave on getting a facial and bleaching , etc done in a hurry.
On not doing a facial properly in a hurry skin pores remain open permanently and pimples occur in them.
In bacterial infection red rashes , injuries with pus , red blotches , swelling and fever , lumps , vesicles , etc can also occur.
In infection lice may occur on skin of body other than scalp.
In protozoal infection on being afflicted with scabies itchy and watery rashes start erupting in hands - feet.
Usually beautician instead of washing her hands starts working for another customer wiping her hands with a towel.
With the same hand pack creams are also taken out with the help of fingers in bottles.
By this cream also becomes infected and the disease causing germs to be found in them can cause a blow to skin , eyes and hair.
Going to the parlors is not harmful if caution is maintained , such a parlor should be selected which is clean and lighted.
While working in the parlor from use of gloves by the beautician danger of spreading of infection is absent.
Women with children or sensitive skin should use an antiseptic lotion after getting hair cut or should wash hair with medicated shampoo so that any kind of allergy of infection is unable to occur.
Woman suffering from allergy , cold and contagious disease should get beauty treatment done at home itself.
As much as possible one should take one ' s own comb , brush , pin , nail cutter , towel , napkin and gown.
It is better if you also use your own beauty products eye liner , lipstick , face powder.
During bridal make up take your own beauty ingredients with you.
On returning home from the parlor change your clothes.
One can stay safe with care only or going to the parlor can also be dangerous.
Water is extremely useful to keep stomach clean , prevent constipation also.
Dark circles under the eyes and lack of water in other problems related to them are also a cause.
Everyone knows how important water is for our body but often we start being careless even on knowing everything.
If we believe the health experts then an ordinary man should drink at least eight - ten glasses of water in the whole day.
Yes , according to the weather quantity can be a bit less or more.
Other than this amount of water intake also depends on the eating habits and hard work , etc of an individual.
If water is called ambrosia then it will not be an exaggeration.
It has many advantages and like there is a proverb in English ' all good things are free '.
Water used to be available for free until now.
Body toxins get expelled by water.
These toxins are health hazards.
If one drinks water in adequate amount then one stays safe from urinary bladder and kidney infection.

The pregnant woman feels weightlessness by sitting in the water and lukewarm water increases the temperature of her body which also increases blood circulation.
This reduces the stress in body and natural pain killers begin to secrete in the body and delivery takes place without any pain.
According to Dr.Urvashi the child remains in the fluid material in the womb and his birth becomes easy in the fluid environment therefore there is no possibility of the like of child being suffocated in the water nor is the child harmed in any way.
The placenta of the child connected to the navel is also cut later on so that the child continues to get oxygen continuously from the mother ' s body.
But all women do not become successful in the water birth process.

Scientists have claimed to have discovered nine genes of diabetes which according to them is a big achievement towards quickly paving the way for treatment of people suffering from this disease.
More than 28 crores people are affected by this disease throughout the world.
Throughout the world a team of 174 research centres studied the genes and blood sugar levels of more than 1 , 20 , 000 voluntary workers and found out such nine genes which control the reaction of body towards the sugar present in blood.
In Type - 2 diabetes the tissues of body become resistant from the point of view of effect of insulin and there is a need of regular glucose.
Patients can control this disease through their meal and exercise but generally taking insulin is necessary.
Through the leader of this Scottish study Jim Wilson of Edinburgh University ' The Times ' said , ' Surprisingly it is an important finding '.
This discovery of genes affecting the level of blood sugar is the first step towards developing new ways of treatments for diabetes.
He said , ' It opens up a new aspect of research in which it could be found out which protein needs drug '.
Scientists have studied people from America , Canada , Iceland and along with Europe , Scotland , Britain , Germany , Netherlands , Finland , Italy , Spain , France , Switzerland and Sweden for their research.

The most important thing for leading the most successful and complete life is - energy.
There is infinite quantity of energy in every person , the necessity is to use it properly.
It is also said that ' if you have talent and energy then you are king , if you have energy but not talent then you are prince , but if you have talent but not energy then you will remain a beggar '.
Because of today ' s modern life style our natural energy is used less.
Therefore by adopting some rules we can maintain our natural energy by which we can take full enjoyment of healthy life.
We can maintain our energy by nutritious and balanced diet.
A healthy diet is 50 percent water based in which fruits and vegetables are included.
Include salad in the meal and by reducing caffeine , meat , dairy , sugar and snacks take nutritious food.
Regular exercise is also a brilliant source of increasing energy level.
For better health and energy it is very necessary to be aerobically trained because it supplies oxygen to the body.
Your lungs , heart , digestion etc will work better only when you are fit.
Research tells that if you have done 12 months of regular exercise then it will be useful for your whole life.
Even then do find at least three days in a week for exercise.
The lower portion of our lungs is larger than upper portion and a correct amount of oxygen is needed for breathing.
Generally taking less deep breaths is common as a result of which several problems also begin to come up in which reduction in energy level is also included.
Therefore take ' power breathing ' at least thrice a day.
For this inhale deeply by counting one , hold the breath by counting till four and by counting two , exhale.
For example if you inhale deeply for four seconds the hold for 16 seconds and exhale in 8 seconds.
Repeat this process for ten times.
In order to renew your energy adopt balanced life style.
When we do a lot of and difficult work then in it energy is reduced in a large quantity and we gain nothing.
Therefore in order to become a successful person finish the work by dividing them properly , work after resting a little.
Balanced life is not formed naturally but it is formed by oneself by keeping in mind one ' s daily routine and work habit.
Emotions are also helpful in reducing our energy level to a large extent.
Those who live in negative emotions stress , depression or any kind of fear , they have a difficulty in being inspired and encouraged towards life.
On the other hand those people who are full of happiness and enthusiasm and who are optimistic have a great energy level.
So adopt positive attitude in life and become optimistic by throwing out tension , fear.
There are also many other factors for increasing energy level but you could surely maintain your energy level by adopting these smaller things.

The director of Delhi diabetic research center Dr.A.K.Jhingan says that now a days such problems occur because of accumulation of protein in the colossal tissue of joint because people stop exercising etc in the name of cold.
Because of stress due to pain the blood sugar level is also muddled which is raising other problems.
In such a situation the diabetic patient should remain aware of their diet and regular exercise.

His I.Q.is improving and he has started to speak some words like mummy - papa.
This three year old child from Dehradun has now begun to walk with support after the stem cells were implanted first time in January.
He has begun to climb up the stairs and the biggest thing is that he has even begun to move forward on the ground without support.
There is also improvement in the shape of his eyes and face.
Praising the H.E.S.C.treatment Satnam says that earlier the left hand of my son was very weak , but he has now begun to use that.
His eye contact is also improving.
For us H.E.S.C.treatment is nothing short of God ' s blessing.
Dr.Gita Sarraf who is treating Hardeep in the Newtek Mediworld at New Delhi by H.E.S.C.Methodology has to say that H.E.S.C.is creating a good effect on Hardeep and I am very happy looking at his development.
Actually the research and discovery of the director of Newtek Mediworld and stem cell specialist Dr.Gita Sarraf has played an important role in the treatment of many incurable diseases like Parkinson , spine injury , cases related to the accident in which the patient has gone in coma , nervous system disease , dystrophy of muscles etc.
She treats the patients with the cell line of the stem cell of the embryo donated voluntarily by a couple , meaning embryo is not needed again and again.
According to Dr.Sarraf developing the cell line of human embryonic stem cell is in itself a big discovery of the medical science in the whole world.
The biggest thing in it is that they have not mixed any kind of animal product in it i.e.it is a completely human product.Dr.Gita is excited on seeing its effect after using this therapy on 700 patients.
You become breathless on climbing stairs , you become out of breath after running for two hundred meters , you become tired after walking to the nearby market.
Do you have this problem ?.
What have you done about it ?.
You took a little rest and then forgot it , but not this that this symptom is pointing towards the deficiency of iron.
First of all you learn how did you contract the deficiency of iron.
The diet that you are taking is that not the balanced diet ?.
Do you like to eat junk food more ? 
Or you remain so busy in working that you forget that after working so hard you must take only balanced diet.
Instead of this you just manage by eating anything.
Whatever be the reason , the reality is that not taking proper and balanced diet could become the main reason of deficiency of iron.
The person becomes anaemic by blood loss i.e.he becomes deficient of blood.
The bleeding occurring in the body which is generally not visible could also cause deficiency of blood.
It could also happen because of piles , ulcer or blood loss from nose.
The deficiency of blood means deficiency of iron.
If energy level is falling , tiredness is causing problems , face has become pale then do not consider others responsible for this.
Your hemoglobin is 13 - 17 gm per 100 millilitre blood.
For women this quantity is 12 - 15 gm per 100 millilitre.
Its being less means you are anaemic.
Children could become anaemic because of the germs in the intestines.
Their physical and mental development is affected by this , but taking iron more than required is also not good for health.
it causes ' mokromatosiz ' which adversely affects the liver.
There are also genetic reasons behind the deficiency of iron.
If there is the complaint of indigestion in your family i.e.sufficient nutrients could not get digested in the intestines , then also you could be anaemic.
If the mother is anaemic during pregnancy then she could give birth to anaemic child.
Many problems arise because of being anaemic.
The feeling of tiredness throughout the day is a problem.
Anaemic means the deficiency of hemoglobin in the body , because of which the body gets less Oxygen.
Women of every age should give special attention to their diet so that appropriate amount of iron intake could be ensured.
The blood loss which takes during the menstruation that could be compensated by the balanced diet.
Those women who lose more blood during the menstruation they should take iron supplements.
According to the World Health Organisation during pregnancy and breast feeding women should take more iron - rich diet.
Its quantity should be 40 milligram per day.
Taking iron supplements is good but do take without the prescription of a doctor.
Start iron only on being suggested by a doctor.
There could be many reasons behind anemia , first it is necessary to diagnose them.
Never take iron supplements in empty stomach.
They should be taken at a fixed time in the day.
Generally it is beneficial to take that food which has more iron.
There is more iron in papaya , mango , pomegranate and banana among fruits while there is more iron in brown rice , sunflower seeds , chickpeas , wheat germ , carrot , beetroot , lotus stem , mustard leaves and green leaves like spinach and cauliflower among cereals and vegetables.
If you are non - vegetarian then take argon meat , red meat , pea food moiser , dry fish for iron.
Include brown rice , barley , lentils , moong , green pea , apple and grapes in your diet , but avoid urad and sesame seed  oil because they take time in digestion.
It is to be noted that the digestive system of anaemic persons are weak , therefore they should eat in less quantity.
In many food stores one gets organic extracts which is nutritious.
If you do not like green vegetables then take their powder extracts.
You will get the powder of cabbage , beetroot , spinach and oat.
Mix two spoonfuls of powder in water or milk and drink that.
Besides these liquid extracts of herbs like dandelion and horsetale are also available which helps in fighting with anemia.
These herbs produce iron in the body and they also do not cause constipation.
It should be especially mentioned that calcium and iron tablets should not be taken together.
Because they interfere in each other ' s digestion.
The complaint of increasing weight is common because of the modern food habits.
Burger , French fries along with being costly also increases the obesity.
Working till late night , stress of the big project , the hanging sword of deadline , unusual eating time and ways put bad effects on the body.
One should avoid saturated fats like beef , lamb , pork , butter , cream milk , cheese , coconut oil.
Instead of this one could control high blood pressure by taking poly unsaturated fats.
Take stock of your body on the weekly basis.
Especially keep an eye on your waist.
Do not hesitate in any way to check the increasing inches.
In this taking lemon water regularly is also beneficial.

Vikas Jain of Agra is one of those fortunate patients to whom despite breaking of bone at the age of 40 neither did the fear of death bother nor did he have to spend too much in doing daily chores.
As a matter of fact all this is the wonder of new hip surgery which treats patients quite soon.
According to senior orthopaedician Dr.B.S.Murthy of Fortis hospital situated in New Delhi now through such new techniques and equipment changing hip has become possible.
According to Dr.Murthy capacity of hip to bear weight is more than all other joints of body on account of being surrounded with cartilage , ligaments and muscles.
He has to say that cartilage is extremely flexible because of which no pain occurs in walking around.
Dr.Murthy says that until hip gets damaged the flexible cartilage of extreme ends of bones remains covered.
According to him on the contrary after getting damaged cushion of cartilage gets removed because of which bone gradually gets rough and holes appear in places.
He says that on walking around and roaming about in this condition ball in the socket starts snagging hence one feels a cramp and pain whereas in a healthy condition of the hip ball rotates easily.
Because of this snagging does not occur and one does not feel stiffness and pain.
Now one can do a hip transplant easily.
They say that these operations can be conducted successfully in India which are also cheaper as compared to foreign countries.
According to Dr.B.S.Murthy this surgery is selected for providing relief from any kind of damage or swelling in hip.
Proxima hip mini hip is such a modern discovery which is an ideal combination between unnatural unsemantid hip replacement transposition.
According to Dr.B.S.Murthy at least six inches of metal is included in unsemantid hip joint on the upper layer of bone of thigh which is called femur.
Dr.Murthy says that with time and with age these joints mostly start snagging.
According to him one has to change them again after 10 to 15 years.
Dr.Murty says that there is fear of the ball getting limp on the surface of hip transplant and also there can be fracture from neck to femur bone.
According to him through mini or proxima hip surgery both these problems can be treated very well with an infinitesimal hostility and along with this itself correction done in young patients also remains ordinary and clear.
According to him there is ease for patients to get a surgery for a second time in life.

Spine related disease scoliosis that produces trouble of heart and lung has been the subject of speculation for ages.
At our place until now people have considered it untreatable whereas in modern medical science its treatment has become quite easy and satisfactory.
From the negligence of which either there can be a hump back or another kind of distortion may occur in the spine.
Along with a hump permanent freedom from other disorders of spine is possible.
According to Dr.Sharma the organization of spine is such that bending of it forwards backwards left - right is possible.
His statement is that there is a disc in the center of vertebra and behind this disc from the center of spine a spinal canal passes the nerves within which go from the brain towards hands and feet.
His statement is that this disc happens to be soft and flexible like rubber through which this spine provides flexibility to the spine.
According to Dr.Sharma the cause of abnormal growth in spine has not been detected yet whereas in other causes there are congenital deficiencies like absence of one - two bones or presence in half or being joint together.
According to him due to unknown reasons number of patients of spine disorder is up to 60 to 70 % , it is called idiopathic scoliosis and 20 to 25 percent patients get this disease because of congenital causes which is called congenital scoliosis.
According to him many patients get hump related spine disorders that occur from weakness arising in muscles due to paralysis which is called paralytic scoliosis.
According to Dr.Manoj Sharma treatment of hump is normally done to end ugliness because these diseases are found more in girls.
According to Dr.Sharma from extreme distortion there can be an effect on lungs and heart hence its treatment is important.
Dr.Sharma says that some distortion can treat itself with age and for it only appropriate exercise or braces jacket is proper but if hump is too much then it goes on increasing with time and patient may land in quite a distorted state.
Also he can become helpless physically.
According to Dr.Sharma treatment of people is possible only through surgery.
According to him these days treatment of hump distortion of back is done according to scientific technique derotation of apical vertebra.If distortion has become excessive or quite old then it is straightened after making it flexible through endoscopic technique.
According to Dr.Sharma inserting endoscope in chest or stomach many discs are taken out from distorted spine , after this spine becomes straight easily.
Earlier this task used to happen through major surgery opening up chest or stomach in which a lot of blood used to flow and recovery of patient was possible after many days and often death of patient used to take place.
Other than this because of occurrence of extreme strain on the spinal cord while straightening out the back there is danger of occurrence of paralysis in feet.To prevent such a situation nerves are also monitored side by side during operation.
According to Dr.Manoj Sharma it is detected late in girls hence diagnosis of disorder in backbone as soon as possible is important.
He says that if it is not treated while there is time then this disorder takes a form and patient becomes ugly.Disease becomes chronic on growing too much.
The permanent treatment of getting rid of any stomach disease is hydrotherapy because it is the modern , simple , scientific European technology treatment of the old fashioned without medicine infallible treatment complete basti panchkarm.
In this the patients can themselves see the real root cause toxins old dried lumps of stool , dryness , many layers of muck , gas , acid , mucous , rot , etc of diseases constipation , gas , acidity , ulcer , piles , etc of your very own stomach coming out.
On uniting with ozone therapy its benefits increase more.
After this you will get saved from expense of churna , medicines forever.

When chuckles of a baby echo in the house then the whole family is filled with happiness but just imagine that you child like playing , developing physically like ordinary children but suddenly being 7 years old has started to look like a 60 year old.
Perhaps this situation is a little strange to you.
There are such innumerable diseases that we are unaware of , progeria is one of them.
Progeria is such a disease a child afflicted with which grows like ordinary children but till the age of seven years.
After that such a turn comes in his life which changes his whole life.
It seems like someone has pressed the fast forward button of his life and he finds himself in the period of senility.
It is the only such family in India where more than one child is in the grips of this disease.
Parents of Ali and Ikramul are Bisul Khan and mother Razia.
They are total seven brothers and sisters from which 5 children are victims of progeria.
One out of which had an untimely death , the other got killed because of pneumonia.
That is to say that it is such a disease the prevention of which can not be made from prior assumption.
A child who is of 11 years of age whose weight should be 25 - 30 kg , height should be 134 - 135 cm his weight is 12 kg and height is 116.9 cm.
No doubt that were made like ordinary children by feeding but the age gap that they have completed in merely a few years will never end.
You will be amazed to know that if the fan is turned on full speed then they are unable to support themselves when they are not helped.
They are mentally absolute children but have had aged in body.
There are many types of progeria.
Out of which Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome H.G.P.S is also one.
The symptoms of this disease are decrease in body fat , formation of wrinkles in skin , reduction of hair.
All those things which are in an old man.
Dr.Ajay Mukherjee has made the statement that it is possible that there is no method of prevention of this situation but it has been seen in the past few years that if some changes are made in their lifestyle and food habits then life can be a bit better.
Despite this the reality is that the normal life that others are leading they happen to be miles away from them.
They are physically weak.
Therefore they become sensitive from even a little sports.
They have to go through every such situation through which elderly have to go through.
Meaning osteoporosis , arthritis , skin related diseases rather they need the help of others for every small task.
They even need help to change clothes.
This has also been detected from a recent study that the children afflicted with progeria that die of ' atherosclerosis heart related disease ' their average age is 13 years.
However it has been seen traditionally that age of patients is on an average around 20 years.
As of now these children know everything , understand and they even know that their age is not very long and yet they try to lead their life in a way different from others.
Water therapy has a dominant position in the therapy - order of naturopathy.
According to the point of view of Louis Kuhne often the main cause of diseases in most people is the accumulation of stool in descending colon.
Currently the only naturopathic simple cure for cleansing or washing descending colon is enema.
Pain reduces at that very time or in a little time.
Without enema one can not imagine the therapy course of naturopathy.
Detoxification of descending colon through enema and diet - change these two are the main foundation pillars of natural therapy.
A naturopath can start therapeutic work only through the means of enema - pot.
If there is only enema pot in the hands of therapists that travel in villages even then he can treat successfully in various situations.
Normally without a catheter use of enema can as such happen.
For children , elderly and weak patients there is convenience in getting up water through a catheter.
Otherwise there is possibility of nozzle coming out by the speed of water , gas or stool.
While giving enema one should take care of condition of patient.
If he is weak or of less life force then you should give him enema of 19 ° - 100 ° water.
You can give cold water or water of less than 18 degrees temperature only to a strong man.
Enema pot should normally be kept at a height of 2 to 3 feet.
In a special situation when the intestines of a patient are weak , there is swelling , injury , ulcer or wound in intestines then one should keep enema pot at a maximum height of one foot and minimum half a foot.
By this water will reach intestines at a very low speed otherwise stomach starts aching with the speed of water.
There is fear of shock reaching the soft walls inside the colon.
Before inserting nozzle of enema inside the anus some water should be first taken out of it.
The air filled inside the tube should come out.
You should apply oil on nozzle or catheter while giving enema.
So that it is able to enter anus easily.
So that no friction occurs in the inner skin.
By breathing deeply entrance of water inside is facilitated.
Water is pulled inside the intestines by deep breathing.
After enema water has gone inside by doing an action like bhastika moving stomach up and down water that has reached inside the intestines exits taking out stool.
If there is inconvenience in stopping enema water then before taking enema itself give a hot - cold compress to stomach for 10 - 15 minutes.
By doing ordinary hot compress also there is help in expulsion of stool.
Enema water starts going inside with speed or water stays cold then sometimes there is stomach-ache.
At that time one should immediately stop water from entering inside.
One should allow water to enter slowly on stopping of pain.
To stop water you can press enema - tube with finger.
If there is a clip then it can be used.
If on doing this also there is pain in passage of water then water should be made to reach the intestines with less speed reducing the enema - pot height.
Pain reduces by this also.
Process of giving enema : -.
By making him lie still on his back - this method is comfortable for patient.
One should give enema to extremely weak patients only after making him lie still.
This condition is appropriate for diseases like typhoid , cholera.
By this there is no chance of any kind of shock reaching the intestines of patient which are already weak.
My making him lie down on right side : -.
This state is considered right for patients of moderate health.
While making the patient lie down one should keep in mind that right leg is straight and left one is slightly bent.
However right leg should also be kept loose not keeping it taut.
By this no pressure may be there on anus.
By doing this one can insert nozzle inside easily.
There is also ease in water going inside.
Making him lie down on left side : -.
Enema is not given in this condition often.
When one needs to take water in less quantity and needs to clean only rectum and descending colon only then it is appropriate to give enema in this situation.
By giving enema this way enema water can be made to reach maximum only till the center of transverse colon.
One can not make it reach the ascending colon.
It is impossible in this condition.
If taking one - one and a half pint water one needs to clean only the rectum then this condition can be considered adequate.
In this state right leg should a little lax and bent.
One should not allow enema water to go beyond transverse colon in appendicitis.
One should not allow any kind of shock to reach wall of intestine.
This state is only appropriate.
Because water of enema can not go diagonal further than the descending colon.
Making one lie down upside down on the chest or on the stomach : -.
The man who has difficulty stopping water immediately has urge of defecation on taking water.
For this this situation causes a lot of benefit in stopping the water easily.
A patient had to take water in the toilet itself out of fear of expulsion of water.
He was given enema in this condition on the very first day and no difficulty occurred in stopping water.
Anyhow due to some reason if difficulty occurs in stopping water then water also stops by keeping the anus pressed with fingers.
Bending the chest on knees : -.
Leaving a weak man for a healthy man taking enema in this situation is beneficial from many points of view.
Anus remains quite high as compared to intestine.
From this water may reach inside descending colon very easily.
Along with this on water filling up fully inside descending colon one does not need to make any kind of attempt to stop water because of location of anus being a little high.
Water remains blocked automatically by it.
In this situation while taking enema one should keep a small soft pad underneath the knees.
By this patient will have no trouble in knees while taking enema.
For a healthy man whose stool has come into the rectum and one needs to use enema only to expel stool.
That stool comes out by one pint normal cold water.
In this state there is no need to mix anything in the water.
Rectum gets stimulation by this.
The quantity of salt in in four pint water should be maximum two tolas and minimum one tola.
Brine has the property that descending colon is unable to absorb this water easily.
This water staying in intestine brings help in thinning and expelling stool.
Mixing decoction of neem leaves : - this water is antiseptic.
The chemical property of neem is cool therefore it reduces the additional heat of colon.
Destroys the worms of colon.
Garlic being antiseptic and because of being acrid destroys germs.
Quantity of garlic becoming in excess by mistake or unknowingly burning sensation in eyes occurs.
Heat of body increases by this.
There remains a chance of distress to the patient.
Squeezing lemon juice : - Enema of this water helps in expelling gas.
You can use minimum one or maximum two lemons in four pint water.
There are two ways of mixing lemon in water.
While giving enema if some water one pint or half pint remains then you should add lemon juice in water.
This way by mixing a little juice in water urge to defecate begins strongly.
Lemon brings a lot of help in separating old stool from colon.
Making the patient lie on right side one should give oil to patient through a syringe.
After that one may give water of enema as per requirement.
By making oil reach first smoothness comes in colon walls.
After this water on reaching gets rid of stool easily.
When there is pain in stomach , because of staying in large quantity if old stool keeps pricking inside stomach , there is gas in stomach and stool - urine is obstructed then enema happens to be extremely useful.
The patient in whose stomach enema water stops , is unable to come out easily , on usage oil by him also with the above mentioned method obstruction of water will reduce or not.
By chance if water has stopped then because of entrance of oil in colon flatulence of colon will come out easily.
By this water will also try to come out because oil is a laxative substance.
Cause of passage of water inside not happening : -.
Sometimes while giving enema water does not enter colon.
It stays where it was in the enema pot.
Its causes are : - Enema - Stool getting stuck on mouth of enema - nozzle and catheter.
Because of this water is unable to come out of mouth of nozzle and water stays stable where it was in the enema pot.
In this condition the part of nozzle or catheter which is inside the anus.
It should be moved up - down slowly.
The faeces that might be stuck on the mouth of the nozzle will be lost and water will start entering inside easily.
The other reason is presence of stiff pieces on the anus itself.
The shape and type of this stool is also of such a type that it sits properly on the anal opening.
On such an occasion one should take out faeces breaking it inserting the fore finger inside the anus.
After this water of enema will be able to enter inside easily.
When stiff stool is full in the descending part from the descending colon then there is obstruction of stool and urine both.
On such an occasion one should make use enema of glycerine or any oil.
One may well not be able to make all the oil inside but on the entrance of even a little oil inside stimulus arises on anus from the contact of oil.
From the pressure of this stimulus stool comes out.
On such an occasion descending colon expands a little on fomenting the stomach with hot water and stool also softens a little.
By this there is facilitation of entrance of water inside.
In a specific situation where there is swelling in the uterus and more pressure is exerted by it on the rectum then also water does not enter inside.
While giving enema to an old woman even the catheter of enema did not enter straight inside , it used to get twisted going a little far.
There was so much expansion and swelling in her uterus that from its pressure the walls of rectum had almost met each other.
By pressing catheter inserting finger inside anus after taking the catheter on top of the pressed wall of rectum it enters inside easily.
Water entered inside only after this.

It is a daily routine in which there is nothing new.
Although when you develop the habit of eating a lot of food then muscles of stomach lose their natural flexibility and size of stomach actually starts increasing hence more than necessary food increases the size of stomach.
In turn this increased capacity of stomach instigates the tendency to eat more than necessary.
It is somewhat like this : If stomach is small then you will feel it to be full soon.
In people with big stomach nerves of stomach do not allow brain to suspect fulfilment until food is available in large amount hence people with a large stomach need more food to feel full which is way more than their need.

According to Pennsylvania State University survey the bigger the serving size is the more you eat.
Gradually reduce the portion of your meal.
When these portions reduce steeply then stomach stays a little hungry and sends signals of hunger to the brain.
If portions of food are reduced slowly then stomach contracts without any problem.
Order for a small plate or eat with someone else.
You will feel satisfaction.

The total mount of iron in body is 4 - 5 grams.
In this about 70 % iron is coupled with hemoglobin in red blood cells.
About 20 - 23 % iron is stored in various tissues in the form of ferretin and hemosiderin.
One finds the problem of iron deficiency in about half the population of the world.
It has become known from researches that more than half men and two - third women in our country are afflicted with anemia.
Tissues get damaged from excess of iron also , even death can occur.
An adult needs 1 mg of iron everyday.
Iron is in abundance in eggs , fish.
We call this iron ' haem iron '.
Its absorption from intestines is about 10 % whereas iron is also present in green leafy vegetables , cereals , pulses , their absorption by intestines happens with less ease.
So possibility of iron deficiency in vegetarians is more.
Absorption of iron from intestines depends on iron stored in body.
Amount of iron in body being less its absorption by intestines increases whereas being more it decreases.
If absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful , it is insoluble and is unable to be used in body.
In blood iron remains attached to protein Transferrin.
98 % is used in bone marrow , red blood cells for production of hemoglobin.
It enters cells through blood and stays attached to ferretin protein in cells , in this form iron is soluble and less harmful.
Body can use them on occurrence necessity.
If amount of ferretin increases in cells then it converts to insoluble hemosidrine which can be harmful for body.
About one gram iron in body is stored mainly in liver cells and macrophage.
On occurrence of necessity of iron stored in body body uses it.
One can detect the excess or deficiency of iron from blood iron level , transferrin and ferretin in body.
Deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in sufficient amount in food , absorption of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less ease , so possibility of deficiency is more.

Iron being in excess can be fatal , hence to expel it from body injections of ferrol are given regularly.
This treatment is difficult and extremely expensive.
Now medicine that makes iron from body ineffective which can also be eaten in the form of a capsule has been developed.
Hopefully it will soon be available in our country as well.
In patients of hereditary homosiderosis 450 ml blood is taken out every week so that there may be no excess of iron.

A new research of AIIMS has claimed that after donating kidney donor women remain happier as compared to such men.
The Associate Professor of Department of Surgical Disciplines of AIIMS Sandeep Guleria has said that after donating kidney he wanted to do an assessment of level QOL of life of donor.
We found that after donating kidney a considerable improvement came in the QOL of donor.
Prof.Guleria said that out of these too more improvement came in QOL of women donors as compared to men donors , especially in the QOL of mothers and wives.
On being asked the reason of research Guleria said we have learned that in most cases women are donating kidneys.
Out of these many were married , many unmarried , some living in live - in relationships , some married but divorced or windowed.
Since possibility of donation of kidney of mothers and wives is more hence we wanted to know that the reason of kidney donation of other women is love or they are compelled to do so.
Guleria has told that for doing so we did a survey with the medium of a questionnaire.
In which research of physical and mental health and social acceptance of donor was done.
A total of 126 donors were included in this research in which 73 % were women.
They said that we asked them a lot of questions.
We asked that are they happy after donating kidney the options of which were , not at all , not very much , a little bit and completely happy.
Guleria has told that they were asked that after donating kidney are they enjoying their life , do they have enough money to fulfil their needs and are they completely satisfied with their personal and physical relationships.
Guleria said that this is basically the point of view of women.
The number of donor women is a lot but mothers and wives looked more satisfied after donating their kidney.
Fear of unbearable pain during menstruation has now started vanishing.
After hypnobirth , water birth , aroma therapy , reflexology and scientology methods of labor pain relief now trend of epidural anaesthesia is growing rapidly.
The reason for it is that where one gets some relief from pain in other methods there itself a mother stays 100 percent free from pain even in consciousness.
Given benefits and demand of this technique not only is its experiment being used in all big hospitals but recently it has been started in AIIMS as well.
Doctors have to say that despite awareness being less nowadays about 25 % women ask for such methods.
Senior gynaecologist Dr.Asha Sharma of Rockland Hospital says that the most important path of pain signal is the backbone.
Signal reaches brain from here itself through nervous.
Anaesthetics stop this signal in the backbones even before it reaches the brain.
In routine anaesthesia the injection is given directly in the spinal cord by which patient faints.
But in epidural injection is applied in such a canal of the lower part of spinal cord that patient does get pain relief but her and the foetus both remain fully conscious and are also able to move hands feet.
During the delivery anesthetic keep talking to the woman.
However during delivery woman is unable to apply pressure on the lower part.
Dr.Sharma says that if epidural anaesthesia is given at the right time with the help of an expert anesthetic then this method is completely safe.
They start given anaesthesia when cervix has open 2 to 4 centimetres.
Former Head gynaecologist department of G.B.Pant Hospital Dr.Neera Agarwal says that this method is new for this place but it is being used in foreign countries for many years.
This facility should start in all government hospitals because an expenditure of just till three thousand more occurs in it.
But due to lack of resources related to anaesthesia and operation theater this is unable to start.
Dr.Agarwal says that there may be some risk in a condition of not getting the epidural anaesthesia in the right way at the right time.
Meaning , blood pressure of woman reducing suddenly.By this heartbeat of foetus may slow down for a little while.
In some people symptoms of acute headache , breathing problem , head reeling on getting up may also occur.
In a condition of getting anaesthesia in the wrong canal the complete lower half of patient may get paralysed and there may be danger to the child in such a condition.
According to Dr.Agarwal body comes in complete control two to four hours after delivery and like normal delivery patient can also go home after a few hours.

An important thing that most people do not know is that rate of metabolism in winters slows as compared to summers and if our eating habits remain same as summer season or amount of food - drinks increases a little in winters then physical weight and fatness increasing during these days is natural.
Its reason is that in winters the direction of body temperature happens to be towards a fall , also this side because of less physical work due to extreme cold there is less expenditure of energy whereas more energy is obtained from having more food.
This very remaining energy increases obesity accumulating in the fatty places of body.
The meaning of obesity increasing is that the limited amount of blood present in body reaching that part of body which has increased because of eating much food.
Because of this brain is unable to get the amount of blood which is required as a result brain is unable to get Oxygen and nutritious substances , glucose , etc is sufficient amount.

In second exercise sensation of heat is given.
This is also absolutely opposite to changes that take place in a state of stress.
Actually when a person is in a state of stress then necessity of blood increases naturally in his  her brain and muscles.
As a result blood circulation begins in that very direction and hands - feet of that person start going cold from limited blood circulation.
During autogenic training one is made to experience heat opposite to it.
In the third exercise an attempt is made to normalise heart and movements related to it.
Since breaths become irregular and shallow in a state of stress by which body is unable to receive adequate fresh air hence in fourth exercise respiratory system is normalised from which person starts feeling himself to be quite relaxed.
In the fifth exercise an attempt is made to release from problems related to stomach.
In sixth and last exercise blood circulation that takes place towards the head is controlled as a result person starts experiencing loss of burden of stress on himself  herself.
In autogenic training power of imagination is necessary which can be developed with regular exercise.
Initially it is not possible to be focussed and mind of the one who is exercising wanders , so one should try to focus.

The whole game is of mind.
It might well not be visible but whatever life we lead or whatever we do that is decided on the basis and in accordance to this mind itself.
We surely walk with our legs but what makes us walk is our mind.
Like mind like life.
Hence it has also been said that ' When the mind wins is a victory , as the mind loses its defeat.'.
Not only this doctors also have this to say that in the diseases happening to human evident or evidently it 's the contribution of mind only.
Most diseases occur because of illness of mind only , even to treat disease of some person more than medicines his desire power is required hence human needs to remain more healthy psychologically than physically.
Specialists have to say that human needs a psychologist more than medicine.
Research and conditions tell us that it is the disease of mind only that does not allow a human to live fully.
Our body falls sick later we fall sick by our mind first.
Truth is that the we overlook our mind just as much as we take care of our body , its beauty.
We procure best cosmetics , best technique , better diet , excellent environment , lifestyle , environment , etc for our body but leave procuring for mind we do not even want to think anything.
Think about yourself.
Most people think that if we think about ourselves we will become selfish therefore they keep moulding their life according to others and keep doing kindnesses to become good.
Doing this is not wrong but do not keep yourself so busy also that you do not even get the chance to think about yourself.
Spare some such time during the day when you think only about yourself and focus on this thing that in the whole day what and how much you have done for your pleasure and satisfaction.
Complete your interests.
Draw some solid conclusions after thinking about yourself.
Definitely fulfil those interests after doing which you feel like you have done something.
The desires and interests that you have been unable to fulfil do those , wear and eat something of your choice , go out places , make friends , etc.
Finish tasks.
Half done tasks also give stress , in whose presence you are unable to focus on new tasks and burden of old tasks does not allow to finish new tasks.
Finish tasks because take some new task or responsibility only when old are finished and make a timetable to finish old tasks.
Bring a change in your routine.
Such a routine causes boredom to mind because of which mind stays sad.
Take a little break from the regular tasks and routine of home - office and do something different.
Do not tie yourself in some responsibility , try not to do that which you do everyday or change the time and place of doing those tasks.
Go out.
The best way to change your mood is that you definitely go out somewhere at the end of the week or month for a couple of days.
We can neither change home or office nor can we renew the faces and environment that we see near us according to us , for this it is important that you go out somewhere and give your mind a new environment , new atmosphere so that mind is able to get peace.
Talk to others.
Not only does mind get lighter on talking to others but we also get a new medium of looking at , understanding life.
Not only this we get to know from the medium of conversation that the one in front is also sad , only we are not sad.
This very knowledge and comparison often helps us get out of our grief.
While talking to others if possible write your diary.
Do not just write your diary also read it at the end of every week and on reading compare your state , mind.
Focus on this thing that which thing was important in life , which less unimportant.
Who we gave how much priority and why.
Which are those things that we did unnecessarily.
What are those demands and desires without which also life can go on properly.
What could we have done and what we could not do , etc.
Read all , think and test.
On doing this not only will heart be lighter but you will be able to direct yourself.
Listen to good music.
Often we listen to music in compulsion or because of necessity , then it is in wedding ceremony or dance party.
According to your comfort , neither do you get the chance nor do you look for the chance to listen to music of your liking.
Truth is that even music has an effect on our mind - brain.
Making a list of your favorite songs fill them in a cassette or CD and sparing time listen to those songs according to mood.
Listen to some such songs also that give you inspiration to live and understand your loneliness.
Have plain  satvik meals.
They say ' like food like mind ' meaning our minds becomes the kind of food we eat.
Hence if possible eat fresh , pure , plain  satvik food and take a balanced meal.
Eat food chewing well and allow it to digest well.
Cry openly.
Often people hide their tears or with the shame that what will people say hence do not cry openly.
Truth is that because of not being able to cry openly various kinds of defects arise in us like - anger , irritability , stubbornness , etc.
Because of which our mind and life get influenced and often we end up doing harm to ourselves with our own hands.
Not being able to cry or for not being to cry openly we produce so much pent up energy inside us that we do not even hesitate to commit suicide.
Therefore whenever tears come by any excuse allow them to come.
Have a deep sleep.
Sleep is not just an activity for physical rest for removing physical fatigue but after having a good and deep sleep mind also gets lighter and fresh.
Muscles get rest.
Sitting idle means keeping your mind empty giving your mind a chance to wander.
Hence keep doing something or the other.
Keep yourself busy so that mind also stays in work.
We mostly do every task for profit or money.
Do some tasks for satisfaction of your mind as well.
Especially apply your energy in creative tasks like - dance , sing , paint.
Do gardening , pet animals and take care of them , do stitching - sewing , etc.
Definitely create something or the other.
By doing this not only is mind focussed in work but it also stays satisfied that we have done something and we also become successful in refining on extracting many hidden gifts.
Yoga and meditation is a good medium for fixing mind.
Through the medium of meditation not only does mind get focussed but we also get a chance to thing right wrong about ourselves.
Not only do our senses get active from yoga but also get in control.
Existing chakras in our body get active from yoga which are helpful in purifying our mind and psychology.
Prevent anxiety.
They say ' anxiety is like a pyre.
It is anxiety only because of which human is always sad and is unable to live the way he wants hence keep yourself away from that company who compel us to get into a habit of something and in its imprisonment start destroying us.
Write all your problems , anxieties and complications then enlist them according to priority and sort them out , which anxiety is valid and which you have produced without reason.
You will find that other than one two all are useless.
After choosing anxieties think why a certain worry is there and what am I doing to be free of this worry.
Then pick up paper and pen and write on it your daily tasks and their priority , you will find that you are not doing anything to be free of your anxieties and your energy is getting spent uselessly in thinking only.
Hence categorise your anxieties and problems , solve them according to priority and keep your mind healthy.
Prevent drugs.
If possible save yourself from any kind of intoxication , then be it beedi - cigarette or tobacco - alcohol , etc.
Intoxication not only affects physical health but taking possession of our mind does not allow it to work properly and getting out of control it goes against us only and does not allow us to live properly.
Make entertainment an important part of your life.
Do not make it a medium of mere time pass.
Look for excuses to make yourself happy.
Sometimes do some things getting away from your age and position meaning do not think that you have grown older or that you have started working on a high post so can not jump and play like children.
Party with friends allies without reason or go out on a trip.
Do not take life seriously but with fun.
Truth is that if you want to keep mind healthy then pay attention to its demand.
Do some things for mind as well , when mind will get a life like that of a mind only then body will be able stay healthy.
Express anger.
One cause of remaining a patient of mind is held anger , pent up energy , frustrations etc.
If all this appears at the right time or gets out then mind can become light and sound.
Yell to get this held still energy out.
Look for a lonely spot and going there say all those things without affectation which you have suppressed inside you for a long time.
Mind will get light by doing this.
If on doing this also anger does not ebb then take a pillow and pound it with your complete strength.
During the pounding repeat all those things inside your mind which bother you.
Do retrospection meaning look at old things again.
To keep mind healthy definitely look at your old things from time to time.
Then they could be old greeting cards kept in your cupboard or letters , gifts or photo album.
Do retrospection of prizes , certificates or accomplishments.
Awaken the strength inside you along with comparison , nurture your lost self confidence and disappointed mind with previous achievements.
See and accept changes in letters and cards , etc.

There is a natural lens in al our eyes , because of some reason a thin layer starts forming on this lens because of which the lens starts getting blurred and our eyesight starts becoming weak in such a situation.
The blurring of natural lens of eyes is itself called cataract.
According to the director of Centre for Sight the senior eye disease specialist Dr.Mahipal Sachdev this problem normally occurs only on aging.
However often the cause of cataract may also be some kind of trauma or metabolic disorder like diabetes , hypothyroid or occurrence of swelling in eyes.
Blurred vision , color appearing faded or color not appearing clear , eyes getting sensitive towards strong light or sunlight , less vision at night , occurrence of more trouble in eyes at night , etc are its symptoms.
According to them a kind of protein is found in the crystalline lens of our eyes , as we age this lens starts becoming opaque also because of many chemical changes in this protein which later produces cataract in our eyes.
They have to say that that its main cause is that light is unable to enter their eyes.
Its treatment happens through operation.
They have to say that there is a very deep relationship between cataract and blood pressure , if blood pressure increases before or during the eye operation of the patient then conducting the operation in such a state is not possible hence it is very important for blood pressure to remain regulated.
They have to say that ability to identify light in dark area and things based on subtle differences in the background is contrast sensitive.
Dr.Sachdev informs us that during surgery the natural lenses of eyes are taken out and artificial lenses are transplanted in their place which is called intraocular lens it is called IOL.
It helps in focussing rays of light on retina from which an image forms and we are successful in seeing it.
They inform us that if ' multifocal IOL ' of patient is done with ' fecoemulsification ' then one does not need to wear glasses after surgery.
On the other hand if you do ' fecoemulsification ' with monofocal IOL then it becomes important to use spectacles while studying anything.
Dr.Sachdev believes that patient has to take a few precautions after operation.

Leave the anxiety of deformed or broken teeth.
Success has been achieved in growing teeth by stem cell of All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Work on treatment of various diseases with stem cell is also going on in AIIMS.

Now these children will not have to stay without teeth or with support of artificial teeth all their life.
Their own teeth can be grown once again.
This center of AIIMS has achieved success in growing teeth from stem cell.
For this this work was begun on 14 children four years back and all those cases are now successful.
Teeth grow only twice in life , this has become a thing of past.
Abroad teeth were being grown by this process from before but this has happened in India for the first time.
Teeth have four levels - bone , membrane , ligaments before teeth and stem cell.

When blood gets accumulated on flowing it is stopped there itself and we wait for its clotting.
In nearly five minutes clot forms from thromboplastine present in blood.
So that hole is sealed with the clot.
A special kind of substance is used in it so that seal does not break and blood inside also remains safe stem cell present in which may new.
In this whole process root canal treatment is used RCT.
Until now infected teeth with germs are also treated by this process.
But now by this process new teeth can be grown by entering the root of tooth.
It is an easy process.
Just that you have to keep in mind two three things.
They informed that on one hand one should begin the process of growing a new tooth only after removing the infection completely.
On the other hand if that place is bled on scoring then one should take special care that blood accumulates in adequate amount so that stem cells important for growing teeth may be available.
Third that seal is applied properly , does not break sometimes in the middle of something else infection does not recur in it.
Normally children from six to ten years of age on getting hurt their dentures also break with their teeth and they remain without teeth.

In many matters women are making the use of this only in the name of women independence , but they do not understand this that how many adverse effects of it can come forward.
Fight against tobacco will need to be done on many fronts.
At public places it has been forbidden to smoke cigarettes , but not on chewing tobacco , although this is also suicidal in itself.
Government and society both have to come together for this.
Those kinds of awareness programs will have to be run against tobacco use and smoking , like the ones which are running about AIDS.
Legal warnings are printed on the packets of bidi - cigarettes and tobacco etc but by smartness the advertisements of these products waste the efforts of not only the warnings , but also all the efforts of bringing awareness.
It has been a long time since the ban on smoking in public places or the order issued , but the situation is getting worse.

Kidney keeps control on blood pressure BP , makes many kinds of hormones which maintains water content in the body , the balance of acids and by which blood pressure remains normal.
Having high blood pressure is considered to be a symptom of the suffering illness of the kidney.
The production of red blood cells in blood occurs with the help of hormones called Crithropiotin in the bone marrow.
In the situation of a failure of the kidney this substance is produced less or is not produced at all by which the production of red blood cells becomes less and a situation of anemia develops.
The kidneys help a lot in keeping the bones strong.
This helps in making vitamin D by which the amount of Calcium and phosphorous remains constant by this the bones of the body remain strong and teeth remain strong.
The bones of babies and children being weak , is the first symptom of the disease of renal.
It is important to keep some considerations for keeping the kidney healthy and safe like drinking 10 - 12 glasses water everyday , doing regular exercise or yogasana , keeping a check on weight , reducing the amount of salt on adult stage beginning , stopping the use of smoking , alcohol , tobacco , gutkha etc , not using kachori , samosa , sewa etc dishes , not taking any medicine on your own without the advice of the doctor , keeping diabetes in check if you have and following the restraints with strictness , all instructions given by the doctor should be followed strictly.

Its recognition is done by the protein antigen found on the surface of the outer membrane of the red cells.
If RH protein antigen are found in the red cells of people then they are called RH positive RH + ve.
If RH protein antigen are not found in the red cells of people then they are called RH negative RH - ve.
95 -98 percent Indians are RH positive and 2 - 5 percent are RH negative.

In this age of science and technology also today malnutrition and are leaving their effects , but the fight against malnutrition is continuing by researchers and doctors.
Complete it.
The main reason of malnutrition is the lack of strength , which is obtained from energy filled meals.
In this kind of meal food , protein , minerals etc are found in proper amounts.
These elements are found in balanced amounts in Spirulina.
Along with supplying the balanced food Spirulina also does the diagnosis of many diseases.
The most important protein in Spirulina is , which is found till 65 - 70 percent , whereas protein in such quantity is not found in any other plant.
Out of ten amino acids important for the body eight are found in Spirulina and because of its protein being soluble in water approximately 85 percent gets absorbed in the body.
Vitamin Calcium , magnesium , potassium , sodium and phosphate are found in Spirulina , which give it the status of a complete food.
Its first use was done for malnourished children and infected women , which was successful.
During this time this came to be known that Spirulina is also helpful in the diagnosis of other diseases.
The researchers worldwide proved this that Spirulina is also effective in pancreas related , thyroid , hepatitis , cholesterol , diabetes , arthritis and night blindness.
In the Africa continent Spirulina has been proven successful in fighting with malnutrition of children in plentiful.

The youth must not remain in this that only aging people can get heart attacks.
Statistics and research done by experts show that among people coming in the grip of heart attack now the number of youth less than 40 years is increasing rapidly.
Saif Ali Khan had to be admitted to the hospital some time back owing to a problem related to heart , then the severe heart attack of fashion designer Rohit Bal.
The signal is clear that the youth is rapidly moving towards heart related problems.
A big reason for this is their bad lifestyle.
A study done by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS is enough to shock.
The study shows that the rate high blood pressure , obesity and heart related diseases in the youth is increasing rapidly.
Especially the youth living in the cities are coming fast in its grip.
According to doctors the fast lifestyle of the youth living in cities , fatty food and the increasing use of alcohol is responsible for this because of which the matter of obesity , high blood pressure and diabetes is increasing among the youth.
Research shows that in such cases the condition of the metropolitan youth is alarming.
Complete it.
According to the study of the World Health Organization the most heart patients in the country are in Delhi after Kerala.
In these people of middle class are more.
Till ten - twelve years before people used to think this that the problem of heart disease i.e.blockage in the arteries of the heart is less in India in comparison to the whole world.
But in various studies and researches this is known that in comparison to the Western countries 2 - 3 percent of people in India are afflicted with heart disease.
Without doubt this is a matter of grave importance.
Before where the possibility of heart disease between 30 to 40 years of age was sketched , today this possibility has reduced and is found in people of 20 years of age and less.
The heart diseases which happen to people in America at the age of 40 - 50 , they begin among the people here 10 years before.
There are many reasons of this.
Today , in the country in less than 40 years of age the problem of heart disease is increasing rapidly.
This rate is seen increasing rapidly towards youth of 20 years.
It is obvious the biggest reason of this is only and only the fast changing lifestyle.
In reality the rate of coronary heart related disease in Indians especially in the youth , has begun to be found to be almost three times more in comparison to western countries.
Today the craze of smoking can be seen to be in many of the youth.
In the form of a base the bad effects of smoking have been recorded not only in India but on the international level also.
According to the WHO nearly 1.1.billion people in the world smoke , in which one third are of the age of 16.
Dr.Trehan says in the matter of the ill effects of smoking , professional people smoke because they feel that by this their tension will dissipate , but they ignore that fact , by which has come forward that this gives a bad effect on their health.
There are harmful things like nicotine and tar in cigarettes and carbon monoxide is enough for destroying the heart.
Normally in our country fried food is consumed in which cholesterol and carbohydrates are more.
In things like pakora , jalebi , samosa these elements are found more.
Actually our food habits are proheart disease.
Low Density Cholesterol meaning LDC is also the result of deteriorating habits of food.
This only pushes us towards the high risk zone of heart related diseases.
Because of these habits only the cholesterol deposited in the veins start making them narrow.
As a result , by this the supply of blood received by the heart gets affected and the possibilities of heart attack take hold.
It is not difficult to control the increasing heart diseases on the youth and children.
Only some things need to be kept in mind.
Everyday for 45 minutes do a brisk walk i.e.walk fast.
Keep a control on the diet.
Use such an oil in food which does not solidify.
There comes a restriction in the flow of blood by it solidifying in the veins.
There is less cholesterol in olive oil or saffola.
One can see the physical exertion getting less in city people.
Most people go in cars.
Lifts are provided in buildings.
Walking on foot is almost not present.
Frequently people can not understand that they have heart diseases.
They see it in the form of gas production or some other problem , but for knowing this that there is no problem coming , this can be understood in three forms.
In step - 1 the beginning of the heart disease has started , but the patient has not known.
There was no harm to the patient also.
In step - 2 there is some chagrin while doing some work , anger comes or feel some pressure or burning on the chest on running , then it can be Angina.
When you feel such symptoms then get warned and get a check up done immediately.
Step - 3 is the most dangerous and comes forward in the form of heart attack.
In this the patient does not only know that there was the reason of Angina or on knowing also he had ignored it.
In such cases the danger of heart attacks increases 20 percent in which the life of the person may be lost.
In these 10 percent of the matters are not able to reach the hospital even.
That is why one must remain very careful.
If there is pain in the chest then do not delay in going to the hospital.
No symptom of enzyma appears in the patients of diabetes.
No warning is received from the side of the body.
Their nerves become numb because of diabetes.
Such people must always get their check up done.
In such youth whose parents have had problems of the heart in them the possibility of these problems emerging in small age can remain.
Meaning if its fear has been expressed on medical basis after the age of 30 then such people may have this problem in the age of 20 also.
If one person has problems like cholesterol , blood pressure and diabetes then he comes in the high risk category.
It is dangerous to have good cholesterol less than 50 and bad cholesterol more than 100.
Such people who smoke cigarettes more then become more careful.
It is not right for blood pressure to be more than 130  85.
Because of thickness coming in the blood also due to clots depositing problems increase in the heart.
Because of deteriorated lifestyle people become stressed and for getting instant relief from tension take the support of smoking and alcohol.
After the blood pressure getting haywire gradually heart related diseases take birth and one does not get to know.
In depression the person feels like eating again and again because of which excess fat starts depositing in the body and the danger of heart attack increases.
These people who are habituated to eating western food and drinks they should get their check up done because there is more sugar and salt in western food , by which flab increases.
After menopause the danger of heart attack emerges , because the veins of the heart remain fit because of the estrogens hormones secreted by the ovaries , that is why women have more danger after the age of 50.
Therefore after the age of 50 get regular check ups done.
Specialists related with the diseases of the heart say that along with keeping the food habits better one should get the habit of regular exercise.
Your family history must also be checked.
If there has been a history in the family of heart related diseases then one should get checked in three or six months.
Anyway in the lifestyle of today people of 40 up should get a check done on the display of any such symptoms.
ECG Electrocardiogram : - ECG is the safest test method.
In actuality heart disease specialists keep an eye on the proper functioning of the heart on its basis.
TMT Tread Mill Test : - When enough is not understood about coronary heart disease by ECG then TMT test is done.
Eco cardiogram : - For measuring the speed of the beats of the heart this check is done.
By this test only this approximation is done that in doing a surgical or medical treatment how much jolt can the heart take.
In these two other types of tests are also done.
Transesophageal echocardiogram TEE : - In this test the pipe going from the neck to the stomach is tested because this pipe passes close to the heart.
This check is done on the coming of the need of any surgical treatment.
Stress Ecocardiogram : - By this test heart wall and its pumping work is seen.
This test is done immediately before and after exercise.
Angiography : - By the medium of this test the percentage of blockage is found.
Doctors have to say that there is some risk in this test and it is a little more expensive also.
The people for whom the situation of angioplasty or bypass surgery arises , they are asked to do this test frequently.
Cholesterol test : - During the time of any problem in the heart the doctor gives the advise of correcting the cholesterol level of the heart.
There is a check for this also.
In this order there is another test which is called homocysteine test.
Its level must be from 0 to 5.
In this only there is a test LPA.
In these tablets of nicotine are given.
Apart from this the doctor also does the check of sugar level , BP etc.
According to doctors there is a direct relation of the rise and fall of sugar and blood pressure with diseases.
Many fears remain in the mind about the bypass surgery used in the treatment of heart diseases.
What is this after all ? 
According to doctors heart fails due to the disfunctioning of the heart valve , blood pressure increase , increase of muscles of the heart and by weakening of the heart.
If there is treatment on time then one can be saved.
The blockage in the vein of the heart coronary artery is called coronary artery disease CAD.
This blockage is due to the deposition of fat , by which the vein becomes hard.
رگو ں کے پوری طرح بند ہونے میں دل کا دورہ پڑنے کا خطرہ بڑھ جاتا ہے۔ 
Of the three major veins of the heart barriers can be formed in any one or all.
In such situation in the operation a vein is taken out from any part of the body and connected to the vein of the heart.
This newly connected nerve starts blood flow automatically in the vein.
Many people feel that sick veins are taken out and new veins are attached , that is a wrong belief.
Sick veins are not taken out instead in that vein a new vein is attached in front of the block or restriction , the blood flow remains intact itself by this.
In the matter of artery blockage bypass surgery is the best option.
Initially bypass surgery was done by stopping the heartbeats.
By this there used to be an effect on other parts kidney , liver , lungs etc.
Now with new method beating heart surgery only that place of the heart is stopped where surgery has to happen.
In the previous method seven - eight bottles of blood was required in the surgery of the heart , whereas in beating heart surgery one to two bottles of blood is enough.
The patient also gets discharged from the hospital in seven days.
In the new techniques of bypass surgery beating heart surgery is successful.
By this the patients have less difficulty , and they get discharged from the hospital in seven days.
Friends , for achieving success it is very essential to wake early morning.
By this the health also remains fine and you feel interested in studies also.
How to get up early in the morning , for this some tips are being given.
Develop the habit of getting up at four or five in the morning.
The time you get up everyday , start getting up 15 to 30 minutes earlier.
If you sleep 15 to 20 minutes less every one or two days then you will start waking up at that time.
Do not keep the alarm clock near the bed , because you can switch off the alarm in sleep because of laziness.
Keep the clock that far that you can hear it.
Do not watch TV till late in the night.
Do not sit for long at the computer.
Sleep early , only then will you wake early.
After getting up from the bed once do not lie on the bed again.
Do not sleep late on days of holiday.
Whatever time you get up every day according to routine , get up at that time only.
Before sleeping decide this that why you have to get up in the morning.
Have to study , have to do jogging or some other work.
If there is a reason to get up then there will be ease in getting up early.
The sight of sunrise is very nice.
The environment is silent.
Cool breezes blow.
Along with the body the mind also becomes pleasant.
By getting up early you will be able to see these sights.
Eating according to necessity does not mean this that one thing should be eaten more.
There is no one food which can fulfil the needs of your body or your strength.
That is why there is necessity of variance in your food.
Eating that same one type of food all the time we limit the nutritious elements in our diet.
So for balanced diet we should choose some foods from the main food groups everyday.
Grains like rice , roti , doubleroti etc they give strength for play and work.
Pulses and milk give us protein and help us in growing.
Fruits and vegetables give us vitamin , minerals and fibers.
Apart from fruits and vegetables we get fiber from grains like wheat , oatmeal etc.
We get help in digesting properly by fibers.
For staying healthy and for growing properly fats like ghee is important.
But by too much fat in the diet obesity , heart attacks and some types of cancer can also happen.
That is why eat things fried in oil processed cheese paneer , butter , cream , ice cream and chocolate etc least.
By eating too many sweets harm can befall your teeth and decay too.
This makes you fat and lazy.
This is true that for growing and for working you need strength.
For this if you eat roti , rice , potato , yam etc and do a little abstinence from white sugar , jaggery , sugar , then it will be better.
After eating it is good to take less sweet things and les or absolutely no sugar in milk , tea or coffee.
Juice of fruits are much better than soft drinks like cola.
Steam pressure , baking or cooking by roasting , is better than boiling because by this beneficial substances can be saved in the food.
For working and taking the enjoyment of life there should be strength in the body.
The body gets this energy by eating.
Calorie , energy of eating If we eat more than the necessity of our body then it will deposit on our body as fat.
After working , reading , exercise , illness for reaching the previous condition and growing , along with fuel there is also the necessity of nutrition.
It is best for the health not to smoke.
There are more than 400 harmful and toxic chemical substances in the smoke of tobacco like nicotine , tar , carbon monoxide etc.
Cigarette , bidi , hukka , chilum , pipe are also harmful.
Similar to cocaine , heroin and other addictive substances , there is nicotine poison in tobacco , which is an addictive thing.
On the addiction of nicotine coming once man starts being dependent on it and can not leave its habit easily.
That is why people who are smokers have difficulty in leaving smoking.
The smoke of tobacco harms your body and cancer of lungs , throat etc , heart disease and are the reason of lung diseases of long duration like bronchitis , asthma etc.
By this tolerance power is also lost.
By this infertility can also occur.
If you want to remain active and fit then say ' no ' to smoking.
Do not be influenced by your friends or by advertisements of cigarettes.
Do not let the eagerness of smoking dominate over yourself.
A smoker also has a bad effect on people near him.
Burning cigarette or bidi throws smoke outside in the air then it increases the amount of smoke in the air.
The people sitting in that room also take this smoke in their lungs.
They become ' passive smokers '.
The meaning of it is this that other people who are not smoking also , even then the harmful effect of cigarette happens on their lungs and heart.
This way the person who smokes causes harm to the members of his family , friends and people near him.
Out of 1000 500 young people who smoke will in the end , die from diseases happening due to tobacco.
Out of 1000 young people who smoke 250 will die in middle age only.
Normally in comparison to non smokers they reduce 22 years of their life.
250 smokers will die in old age but they will have remained sick with diseases happening due to tobacco.
If smokers can make up their minds , they can leave it.
For this there is the necessity of mental strength and determination.
The attachment of this addiction puts him in difficulty many times , but with his trying and the help of his family and friends can achieve victory over this.
Tobacco is harmful in any form.
By chewing tobacco cancer of oesophagus , stomach and urinary bladder happens.
For making cigarette many trees are cut every year wood is burnt for preparing tobacco.
Someone has cut a tree somewhere behind every three hundred cigarettes.
You are yourself responsible for your health.
Those people who inspire you to smoke , do not listen to them.
For doing weight loss people start staying hungry and the effect of this is seen clearly on their health.
In reality when we reduce eating then its meaning is this that we stop giving the body such necessary elements , which is essential for a healthy body.
That is why whenever you think of reducing weight , keep this thing in mind that there should not be a lack of nutritious elements in the body.
Always take proper and healthy diet.
In some people there are weight and health problems on becoming adults , because they diet and take unhealthy weight loss diet for weight loss in childhood.
For decreasing weight the permission for dieting is not given till then , till there is not complete physical development and this condition comes by the age of 18.
If you are less than 18 years and are overweight then consult your doctor or dietician.
They will tell you such a healthy diet plan by which along with good health weight will not increase.
For this talk to your parents also.
Studies say that strict dieting done for some time in teenage becomes the reason for ' Low Bone Density ' , which makes the bones weak with advancing age.
It has been found that in 90 percent of those who diet in the age of 12 - 17 have had lack of ' bone mass ' on becoming adults.
That is why from childhood you should definitely take the requirements of your body like calcium , vitamin D or vitamin C and all other nutritious elements which are important for bone growth.
Dieting also becomes the reason for the deficiency of folic acid and iron in the body.
These two save from nutritients anemia.
Because of staying busy in school , sports and other activities in that age you should refrain from the ' ill - effects ' of anemia.
Strict dieting can never keep your health and diet alright.
Give preference to healthy food and daily exercise.
This helps in keeping the weight controlled along with your health.
Healthy diet ' is not only one.
You are eating various types of food for a long time , all the vitamins , minerals and other nutritional elements which are necessary for you , are found from the main food groups fruits , vegetables , grains rice , oats , meats , dairy products , fats.
The meaning of healthy food is not this that you stay away from high calorie foods like ice cream , toffee , popcorn , cheese burger etc.
You eat these and foods similar to these but in small quantities and sometimes.
As beautiful as a strawberry looks it is as much filled with benefits.
Like other berries high amounts of anti oxidants especially anticyanine type - 2 and ellagitannins are found in strawberries.
Because of these pigments the color of the strawberries is red.
Researches have proved this that anthocyanins like antioxidant lessens the diseases related to cancer , cardiovascular disease and inflammation.
As such strawberry is a foreign fruit and it is considered the favorite fruit of Europe.
But now it is favored a lot in India also.
Because of this reason only in some mountainous areas of India the farming of strawberries has started being done.
The main reason for the increasing fascination towards this fruit are the medicinal properties found in this.
In this there is already an abundance of potassium , iron , calcium and vitamin A and C because of the capability of not letting cholesterol build in the body this fruit is especially miraculous for heart patients also.
Apart from eating it raw in the form of a fruit it is used in squash , jam and many other foods for strawberry test.
In the plant of strawberry which grows to four inches the fruits grow in the form of bunches , which become of a deep red color on ripening.
These fruits can be kept safe at the most for two days only.
Not only this , on keeping in the freezer also black spots appear on them.
That is why for preserving its qualities they should be kept in the open and should be consumed as soon as possible.
Take fruits in the form of snacks.
Keep some walnuts in them for extra crunch.
Eat light sweets also.
The dinner of your choice : - The most easy way of taking a healthy meal is that you decide that you will take half plate of vegetables and on the other half proteins meat , eggs , beans and carbohydrates rice , roti , paratha , pasta , potato , noodles in equal portions.
If you want to eat pizza then give preference to cheese and pepperoni in light pizza and vegetables and fruit pizza in heavy pizzas.
If some child is more fat with relation to his age or body mass density BMI or if the amount of body fat in the body is found to be more then he is overweight or a victim of obesity.
Especially if a child of 3 - 4 years or some child is afflicted with obesity then by this a bad or negative effect falls on his health.
Physician doctor K.K.Agarwal in Moolchand hospital says , those children who are excessively fat , there are two main reasons for that - first genetic in which is present the genetic factor and the other life style in which is present lifestyle , food habits , environment factors etc.
In genetic factors if the parents or some family member is fat then the child may also be fat.
If the mother - father both are fat then there remains 80 percent possibility of the child being fat and 40 percent when some one from mother - father is fat.
In children fatness begins from three years of age only.
In today 's fast life the busyness of elders has increased so much that they have started showing negligence towards the food habits of children along with themselves.
Now fast food full of high calories has taken the place of healthy food.
According to Dr.K.K.Agarwal , today in place of nutritious salad and fruits children give attention to pizza and burger whose result is coming forward in the form of excess fatness.
Being almost not involved in physical activities , giving attention to hours of virtual gaming , electronic games , video games and watching TV etc increases the calories which is the main reason for weight increase.
The effects of fatness happening in children can be divided into two parts psychological or emotional effect and physical effect.
Digestive related problems are also common in fat children like the complaint of indigestion , constipation etc always remains.
Obesity in childhood becomes a condition of chronic medical condition.
Those people who are afflicted with obesity from childhood in them the danger of chronic disease is more than those who smoke , drink a lot.
Excess fatness in small age also becomes the reason for infertility on growing older.
By this because of sleep and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa , shorter life span , high cholestrol , high blood pressure , lack of stamina and overweight body mass the complaints of pain in joints and bones etc can be seen.
Today obesity in children throughout the world is going on increasing in an alarming way.
Physical inactivity , a diet full of fats and calories and genetics pushes children towards obesity to a large extent.
Through a strict and balanced diet obesity can be brought in control.
Especially parents should also make use of balanced diet only then their kids will not be genetically influenced.
Along with that it is very important to exercise daily , encourage children towards physical activity , stop them from watching TV for more than 2 hours , and give them nutritious diet instead of junk food.
Treatment is also a way for obese children.
Like stomach bypass surgery and liposuction prove very effective in this.
Capsicum is such a vegetable , which is available in green , red , yellow all three colors.
Originally this is a vegetable of America.
In reality its farming is happening for thousands of years in tropical America.
Its farming is done in our country also and it is used in the form of a major vegetable.
Its use is done in the form of a medicine and hotness in vegetables.
Apart from its unique taste and fragrance a high level of nutrition is found in capsicum.
Many types of proteins and fats are also found in this.
Vitamin A and C and provitamin E , P , B 1 , B 2 and B 3 etc are also found in this colorful vegetable.
Its mucous membrane is beneficial for eyes and skin.
This also saves from infection.
By helping in reducing blood pressure this promotes cardiovascular health.
It makes the basic elements of tissue and cell damage ineffective by the antioxidant properties.
This helps in reducing cholesterol as a result of which the possibility of stroke and heart attack becomes less.
By increasing the speed of metabolism this burns more and more calories.
This also works in the treatment of cold and fever.
This increases digestive power.
For patients of diabetes capsicum is helpful.
Meat is not the natural diet of man.
Those people who eat meat , uric acid is produced in more quantity in their blood.
This uric acid gives birth to blood disorders , heart disease , tuberculosis , insomnia , hypertension , liver disease etc apart from arthritis and urinary disorders.
The fat present in meat and the excess amount of cholesterol gets deposited in the internal vessels of the blood vessels of the body of a carnivorous person and makes them narrow by which a restriction is generated in the blood flow.
The fat present in the fat and ghee obtained from animals , butter , meat , fish , eggs increases the amount of cholesterol in the blood with rapidity , by which the situation of high blood pressure starts developing.
So much so that by paralysis and the restriction in the blood of the heart by bleeding in the brain heart stroke and heart attack can also happen.
Most stones in the gall bladder are made by cholesterol.
If a person decreases the amount of cholesterol in the diet then he can escape from the disease of the gall bladder.
Healthy kidneys of a person can do emissions of uric acid in the quantity of seven grain everyday only.
But enough pressure falls on the kidneys on more amount of uric acid by a carnivorous by which stones start forming in them or swelling starts happening in its cells.
If this situation remains for a long time then the kidneys stop working.
In reality meat is not the food of man.
The organization of his body , teeth and food pipe also does not have any similarity to the composition of the intestines of carnivorous animals.
Like carnivorous animals the length of the small and big intestines of man is more than even four times the length of his body.
Along with this , for meat many times the murder of such animals is also done which are sick.
This way through corrupt meat germs or poisonous harmful substance reach the body and become the reason of the disease.
If you do not consider that you look ' dashing ' by a cigarette attached to your lips then change your thinking , because it has been asserted in a new study that the IQ of a person decreases by smoking.
The Intelligence Quotient scale of intelligence measure of a person is less in comparison to a person who smokes cigarette.
It was found in a study that smoking has to do with the IQ of a person.
According to a published study in addiction journal , the average IQ of persons who do not smoke remained 101 whereas smoking persons remained seven points less 93.
The IQ of youth smoking more than one packet in one day remained nearly 90.
Does sexual activity decrease with the increasing age , this question has been the topic of debate for a long time but it has been said in a report published in the British Medical Journal recently that its strings are attached to healthy life , especially in males.
In old age in comparison to women men remain sexually active more than twice.
This matter came forward in the studies of the researchers of the University of Chicago.
It has been said in the studies , ' Men and women of very good health , are more active in comparison to men and women of average or bad health '.
It has been said in this that men and women of good health can show 1.5 to 1.8 times more interest in sex in comparison to men and women of bad health.
Associate professor Stacey Teslar and research associate Natalia Gavrilova has produced this conclusion on the studying of more than six thousand data of 25 to 85 years.
It was found in the study that ' in old age and in the life after that sexual activity , quality of sex life and interest in sex - is positively related to health.
For men the sexual activity time is more long , but because of bad health in comparison to women men lose more years of sexual activity.
In the published report this was also found that those people who remain more sex - active , there is more hope of their being more healthy.
In this it is said that , ' In men among people active in a sexual way good health is linked to this sex specially.
It was also found in the report that similar healthy sexual relations , are not the same in men and women.
For instance , at the age of 55 in men of very good or grand health in comparison to men of bad health an increase of 5 -7 years ordinarily happens in sexually active life.
This thing is not applicable on women.
In women with very good or grand health in comparison to women with bad health there is ordinarily an increase of 3 - 6 years in the sexually active life.
It was found in a study that sexual activity , sex life of high quality and interest in sex is more in men compared to women and this keeps increasing with age gaps.
They said the brain of men first hears the music and its lyrics together , and then during a complex process understands the lyrics.
After this the brain starts behaving differently with both.
They got to know from the MRI of a music listening person that when the active part of the brain gives attention to the music and when it gives attention to the lyrics of the song.
Scientists got to know that neurons process again and again with one then with time their response starts decreasing.
They accepted that when they decrease and increase only the voice and keep the rhythm there then the areas showing less activity must certainly be working on the lyrics of the song.
They prepared four sets of six different songs which volunteers were made to listen.
During this scanning of their brain was done.
After this test the top scientist connected with the team Daniela Sammler said , the brain initially takes music and its lyrics together.
After this the brain goes through a complex process and understands the lyrics.
After understanding the lyrics the brain starts behaving differently with both.
The thyroid gland can become a danger for your young age.
Yes , it has been claimed in a new study thyroid increases the danger of a heart attack in young people till quite an extent.
According to the Stroke Journal of the American Heart Association researchers have found in their study that if thyroid is more than usually active in young people then it increases the danger of a heart attack in them up to 44 percent.
Researchers did this comparison with those people in whom this gland remains constant.
The main author in the journal and Professor Hernag - Ching Linn in the Taipei Medical University of Taiwan was quoted as saying ' Our study shows the relation between Hyperthoidism and heart attack '.
The attacks about which we can not find out they are between one third to one fourth of the heart attacks which come in young age.
Linn said in our knowledge hyperthyroidism has never been seen ever as a big danger in the heart attacks happening between 18 to 44 years of age.
It is interesting that the more than necessary remaining active of the thyroid gland is called ' hyperthyroidism '.
This is a common problem which shows its effect in 0.5 percent one in every 200 to 2 percent one in every 50 people in the population of the whole world.
In the Lavanya Ayurvedic Cancer Hospital and Research Centre the treatment of cancer is possible from the root by ayurvedic medicine.
There have been innumerable successful uses of finishing the cancer disease from the root.
Thousands of patients have got life profit.
Because cancer is a distortion occurring at the level of D.N.A.of cells and ayurveda medicine is successful in making the distortion at the D.N.A.level of the cell alright.
In the Lavanya Ayurvedic hospital there has been the successful treatment of many cancer patients of the country and abroad.
Cancer happens because of the increase on an arbitrary basis in the cells of the body.
When this increase takes the form of a wound and does not heal for a long time then its checking is done through CT scan ultrasound.
If this growth is found to be increased then through F.C.or biopsy the checking of the samples extracted from this is done so that the confirmation of this matter is done that it is cancer or not and if it is then in what state.
After this check surgery radiotherapy , chemotherapy and sometimes by giving hormonal supplements the attempt of a cure can be done.
Along with this on doing operation as soon as scissors run on the cancer cells its unchecked growth becomes even faster and again the support of radiation and chemotherapy is taken.
Radiation occurs through X - ray or Cobalt - ray by which along with cancerous cells many healthy cells also get destroyed.
By exposure to radiation for a long time the body can not get over and the dangerous side effect is this that the cells battered by radiation come under the grip of cancer the fastest.
This way there is a basis of chemotherapy is to destroy the chemical substances of the cancerous cells so that their unrestricted growth can be checked.
But because the chemical substance can not recognize that which cells are cancer affected and which are healthy cells without cancer.
That destroys everything outright by which healthy cells also get influenced and become incapable.
When the capability of cells in the body finishes then the spread of cancer from one place to the other or activity of the metastasis increases.
The other ill effects of chemotherapy are very bad like the fattening of the skin of the body , the digestive activity going bad , not feeling hungry , mouth remaining continuously dry , loss of hair and the fattening of the nerves because of which while giving drip one has to face difficulty in piercing injection.
There are many ill effects of the medicine given by hormonal supplements.
This way we see that with these three types of medicines the patient gets respite for a few days , but for correcting the distortion come on the D.N.A.level of the cell one has to understand the Tridosh theory Vata , Pitta and Kapha by which the conduct of the whole body happens.
We can understand this by the example of an engine of a car.
The engine runs by the birth of pressure of compressor the vata dosh of Ayurveda as if does the work of the compressor for the engine styled body.
If the compressor becomes more than usually active then there can be an explosion in the engine.
If the compressor is less then the engine does not take pick up.
Along with the compressor being made the temperature of the engine also increases.
The role of the gall in the engine styled body is like temperature.
If the temperature of the engine increases more than necessary then the engine gets and if this becomes less than necessity then the engine does not start only.
Now if you are making the temperature of the engine favourable and there is not enough friction in the internal parts of it then the use of lubricants is necessary.
This way if there is no friction in the parts of the body and the temperature remains favourable then it is essential for a kind of viscosity to remain made.
This work is of kafa in the body.
If the lubricant is less then the engine and if it is more then the engine misfires , exactly like this the condition of the engine styled body , the happens due to the lack of kafa happening more.
After understanding the Tridosh theory now we look at the metabolism happening continuously in the body.
Whatever we eat , drink , goes in our stomach and by this activity begins in the.
The nutritious element of the food from the intestine changes into blood , meat , fat , bone , semen and energy respectively this is called dhatu in Ayurveda.
In the activity of their making there is some remaining part which is shit.
It is not enough for the nutritional elements to reach the body only how they turn into dhatu and shit with the help of , this is an important issue of life and health.
This can also be understood with the help of an example.
There is a fire ignited in the fire pit and samidha is being poured from the top.
If the fire is being lighted in the correct manner then the samidha will take the form of ash , but if we went on putting more samidha in the fire than its capacity or if we put more wood in the fire then then fire will get dim , then the samidha will not become ash but start turning into coal.
Exactly like this more food taken in than the capacity of hunger remains indigested , then stool become abnormal or underdone and becomes what is called aam which begins the activity of spreading rot.
Then instead of the food being prepared with full energy begins turning into ' dhuan ' or gas.
Nutritional elements are reached by blood vessels in every cell situated in the body.
Where the activity of catabolism takes place by the fire of the cells.
When this falls low then nutritional elements are not digested properly.
They stay stuck in the cells , can not come out in the form of shit.
Such unrecognizable cells are known by the name of free radical cells in modern medicine and the activity of catabolism is known by the name of deoxidation.
The first starting of cancer building is considered from here only.
If we sketch this condition of the unrecognizable cells on the criterion of the theory of the afore mentioned Tridosh of Ayurveda then we can say this that there can be three reasons for this condition of the cells - Vata , Pitta and Kafa.
If the Kafa i.e.lubricant or viscosity increases then it will narrow or choke the hole of the cells because of which the waste of the cells will not be able to come out.
If Pitta increases then because of the temperature increasing their size increases due to the ionic change in the outside walls of the cells.
And the holes become choked.
This way if the Vata increases then it squeezes the cell from the outside.
By this also the holes of the cell get blocked.
We saw that on the increase of all three Kafa Pitta and Vata the result came out as the same that the holes of the cell closed.
According to Ayurveda it is important to know for the increase of which dosha in the three especially has the disease occurred.
The diagnosis of Ayurveda is not only the result but also to understand the circumstance of the of dosha the patient.
Although in modern medicine in view of the result the medicine is given but that medicine may be increasing the Pitta and the cells have closed because of the increase in Pitta , by this instead of benefits the possibility of harm increases.
In Allopathic medicine there is no way of knowing this that the holes in the cells occurred due to the which special reason of the three , the treatment starts without knowing the actual reason then the imbalance between the three dosha of the body becomes even more.
As a result the condition of the cells begins to worsen more , it moves more towards being incurable.
One thing more is worth knowing that according to Ayurveda if there can be damage of 6 levels inside of the cells like - Save collect , Prasar spread , outbreak infection of cells , dwelling place space loss , individual cell damage , differentiate change in the identity of the cell.
When the activity of battering starts happening in the cells then its nucleus or DNA as if starts experiencing this that its identity will not be preserved.
During this the nucleus catches the tempo of multiplying many times by dividing itself and forgets the instructions of the commander styled brain.
Here the meaning of the instruction of the commander of the brain is that instrument or apparatus under which so far it was driven.
Like in the body if generally some part gets injured then the cells and tissues there give their full contribution according to the formation of that place.
But when the cells become rampant then they become not favourable of the body but unfavourable.
Medicine in Lavanya Ayurvedic Hospital and Research Centre happens according to Yukti vyapakshya , Devopakshya and Satvavajay through Ayurveda.
Unber the Yukti vyapakshya first the Panchakarma of the patient is done.
The prior work or preparations of Panchakarma are - Pachan Digestion , Snehan Lubrication and Swedan.
After this under the activity of purification are Vamana , Virechana , Vasti , Nasya and Raktamoshana.
Under purification medicine the most important thing is this that the possibility of common diseases occurring a second time finishes.
By Panchakarma the three dosha of Vata , Pitta and Kafa go away.
In other words with Panchakarma the entire body becomes detoxified or free of toxins.
All cells of the body become pure and clean.
Because cancer is a difficult disease , that is why its treatment is not possible with only plants and herbs.
For this one has to take the help of chemotherapy.
If the disease is outside then its miasma can be removed by the use of the medicines on the particular place of the body.
But if this is inside the body then in this condition the use of medicines applied on that particular place would not have been possible.
Therefore in these matters treatment is possible only by the medicines taken through the mouth.
Here also if the miasma of the ulcer is in the beginning stage then success is achieved and if the part of the body with the ulcer has melted and finished then till what extent will success be achieved , this can not be said from before.
But it becomes essential to cut and remove that rotten part of the body but in this condition also the tendency in the cancerous cells to increase itself somehow with uncontrolled and fast speed has been finished from before.
After having given radiotherapy and chemotherapy many times also the cells which were still being a challenge to medicine the activity of their proliferation stops.
Therefore this is a matter of happiness that in these matters also success is fully possible.
This way a campaign is going on in Lavanya to finish cancer from the root.
For children and teenagers obesity has been considered a big matter that is why for saving them from obesity some parents and children themselves too keep their footsteps carefully.
In these important precautions is also included not letting them drink too much fruit juice.
It is considered that not letting them drink fruit juice is also included.
It is considered that fatness increases due to fruit juice.
But recently this matter has come forward by a study that if the fruit juice is hundred percent pure and sugar is not mixed in it then that does not become a reason for fatness.
This study was presented in the meeting of the paediatric society happening in Toronto of Canada.
This is quite an important study , because it has been ascertained by this that there is no danger of fatness by pure juice and it can be taken in appropriate amount.
But in relation to drinking this juice some things have to be kept in mind.
Like this that the canned juice you take from the market should be 100 percent pure juice of fruit.
If other nutritious elements are mixed in it then also it is important to keep this information that there should not have been any negative effect on the quality of its fruit.

It was obviously seen in the study that tumor if not treated can become life threatening , but this thing came up too that the smaller tumors of the cancers even when they were not treated were not visible after some time during the screening or their development stopped on their own meaning they shrunked.
In some cases of breast cancer it has even been observed that the tumors disappear automatically.
The earlier perception concerning cancer was this itself that it is a long procedure , in this first the mutation starts in one of the cells that is alterations starts coming in its composition and function.

Or else if there is some big tumor visible near the kidney of some young man , then the doctors assume this itself that it erupted somewhere else , hence they try to locate it first.
In this process they find a big mark on the testicles of that man , which is the only evidence of the original cancer.
There they get no tumor.
Generally the cancer of the testicles does not happen and other cancers mostly do not disappear , but now the evidence of this are constantly being found that cancer can return or else terminate.
Hence now the researchers are being pressurized that the earlier cancer related assumptions , they test them again and try to undersatnd what cancer actually is and how does its development takes place.
Surely generally cancer does not disappear and nobody is giving this advise that on the basis of these few incidents the cancer patients stop getting their treatment.
It is rarely seen that cancer would give the patient leniency after taking a serious stage.
But after knowing how cancer develops and how it sometimes disappears , it would definitely help the doctor to decide which tumor should be left like that and which should be treated.
In most of the cases the doctors were not able to decide this thing.
The cells with cancer and those cells which would be converting into cancer cell , those are umpteen in every middle aged or old aged person.
This fact was known after the autopsy of those people , whose death took place due to other reasons and they did n't know before dying that they had cancer cells or the cells due to convert into cancer cells in future that are the pre cancerous cells.
They did n't even have the complaint of any big tumor nor were there symptoms of cancer.
Here this question is n't interesting that why do we have cancer , but this question is interesting that despite us having the cells that convert into cancer cells in the future why do n't we get cancer ? 
According to the researchers a simple cell approaching to convert into a cancer cell , its possible that it becomes normal again.
Understand it this way - those cells which are proceeding to produce cervical cancer , they all of a sudden revert back to the normal condition.
In one of the studies it was known by doing a pep test that 60 percent of the pre cancerous cervical cells became normal within a year , whereas 90 percent of such cells took three years to become normal.
Today there is a talk of the rapidly spreading cancer , because with screening the cases of breast and prostrate cancer can be known in huge numbers in the early stage itself.
Due to lack of screening this was n't there earlier.
Now if it is believed that it is necessary for the early stage cancer patients to have a serious condition , then the number of the early stage patients after the screening should be equal to the number of the serious stage patients.
But this thing is n't observed in the screening of breast and prostrate cancer.
Hence people believe that many of the first stage cancers do not disappear.
Yes , some oblique evidences of the disappearance of breast cancer have been found.
But to say regarding the disappearance of prostrate cancer is difficult.
The researchers say that they doubt the concept that this cancer disappears.
But they do say this much that many cancers terminate after thriving in the body or their development happens way too slowly.
This thing has come up in many studies.
There are around 70 lakhs of blind people in our country.
